# {meta.title}

Prim+RPC includes additional (and optional) tooling that can make working with Prim+RPC even easier.

## Prevent Import Utility

Since Prim+RPC allows you to import type definitions from your server, there's the possibility (although unlikely) that
some developer makes the mistake of importing a function from the server. Generally these errors can be caught fairly
quickly because many server-side tools will throw errors on the client however when you're using isomorphic/universal
tools that work on both server and client this may be harder to catch.

The Prevent Import Utility is very simple plugin for the build tool of your choice (using
[unplugin](https://github.com/unjs/unplugin)) that just prevents imports of a specified directory or file, like those
from the server. You can use it like so (we'll use Vite as an example):

```typescript
import path from "node:path"
import { defineConfig } from "vite"
import preventImport from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-tooling/build"

export default defineConfig({
	server: { port: 3000 },
	plugins: [preventImport.vite({ name: path.join(__dirname, "server") })],
})
```

In this example we assume that server-related code is located in the same directory as the Vite config (`./server`).

Now if we try to import a function directly from the server (the code itself, not the types as used with Prim+RPC) that
function call will fail because the plugin replaces all server imports with an empty export (`export {}`).

## Documentation Generator

The Documentation Generator is a tool that reads [TypeDoc documentation](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc) and
creates a simpler RPC-specific documentation for your code.

	This RPC documentation process is intended become more streamlined in the future.
</Alert>

First, it's suggested that you document your code using TypeDoc's format. Next, you can generate TypeDoc with its CLI
(this is not Prim+RPC related). We'll pretend your code lives at `src/index.ts`.

```zsh
npx typedoc src/index.ts --json dist/docs.json
```

Now we can use this generated `dist/docs.json` file to generate RPC-specific documentation.

Below is a simple script that creates the documentation.

```typescript
import preventImport from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-tooling/docs"
import typeDoc from "./dist/docs.json"
const rpcDocs = createDocsForModule(typeDoc)
```

<Alert icon="carbon:warning" type="alert-warning">
	In the future, basic JavaScript types will be turned into JSON Schema for typed usage outside of TypeScript. It's not
	planned to support all TypeScript types in RPC documentation since it doesn't make sense to use them outside of
	TypeScript but basic JSON Schema support could be useful for using Prim+RPC outside of JavaScript environments.
</Alert>

The resulting documentation is a simpler version of the TypeDoc that relates to RPC. This output could be used for a
documentation website or fed to another tool like [HTTPsnippet](https://github.com/Kong/httpsnippet) to generate
requests for other clients outside of JavaScript.
