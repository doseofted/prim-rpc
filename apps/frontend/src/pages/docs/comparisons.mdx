Why use Prim+RPC over some other framework? What does Prim+RPC offer in comparison to other frameworks? If I've already
learned another framework then how can I find the equivalent features in Prim+RPC? Let's answer these questions by
comparing Prim+RPC with other popular methods of transfer and frameworks.

First, it's important to know Prim+RPC only concerns itself with making RPC and offering tools that assists in making
RPC. It also is not intended to completely replace your existing tooling (like an HTTP server) but rather work alongside
them. Although in some cases, you may be able to replace some tooling.

Some tools are easy to compare against Prim+RPC. For instance, GraphQL is a form of RPC so it's easy to make a direct
comparison. Since GraphQL is so popular, it's also the first framework that we'll tackle. Other frameworks however are
harder to compare, such as Prim+RPC versus a REST API using a framework like Express or Fastify. While some of your HTTP
routes could be replaced with RPC, it's not intended to replace these frameworks. There are different goals for using
each. Regardless, we'll discuss the differences and how Prim+RPC can be used alongside a REST API or as a replacement
for it.

Naturally, all of these comparisons will be biased towards Prim+RPC since it's written by the same author but it's
intended to make a general comparison for those unfamiliar with Prim+RPC but familiar with another framework.

Enough disclaimers. Let's discuss.

## Table of Contents

## GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a form of RPC that comes with its own query language. You define a schema up front
for your methods, parameters, and returned types in GraphQL's SDL and then you use special types to get this data back
using the GraphQL querying language. These special types include: queries for reading data, and mutations for changing
data. Once all of these types are defined, it is then time to implement these queries and mutations in the language of
your choice which are expected to strictly adhere to the types that you have defined.

Prim+RPC is also a form of RPC however it doesn't have a built-in querying language. Instead it relies on the features
of JavaScript. A request with Prim+RPC is synonymous with making a function call in JavaScript. Because of this, there's
no separation between queries and mutations. Instead you are expected to use your own naming scheme to determine what
will read data and what will write it.

Prim+RPC also doesn't have a separate type system. Instead types are completely optional and can be utilized with the
language that you're already programming in. JavaScript itself doesn't have a strongly typed system but TypeScript is
widely adopted today. This means that you can define types to be as strict as you'd like in TypeScript and then enforce
these rules when someone utilizes your RPC library with JavaScript/TypeScript. Unlike GraphQL, these types are only
understood at compile-time which makes Prim+RPC very flexible. This doesn't mean that Prim+RPC isn't capable of
following a type system however. There are popular libraries like [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) and
[TypeBox](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox) that provide schema validation that can be used in the place of
something like GraphQL's type system. Unlike GraphQL, you're not restricted to the types defined by their language but
rather you can choose to validate your data however you'd like by taking advantage of the JavaScript ecosystem.

Unlike GraphQL, Prim+RPC is a tool designed for usage in JavaScript. While you are welcome to use Prim+RPC outside of
JavaScript, since the RPC is very easy to structure and understand, it's expected that you are at least running a server
that uses JavaScript. This is largely because Prim+RPC builds on top of JavaScript language features. By directly
supporting some other language, Prim+RPC would need to consider additional constraints such as those imposed by a
programming language's meta-programming abilities or lack thereof, type system, and overall design (for instance,
Prim+RPC relies on the fact that JavaScript functions are also Objects, that TypeScript types are structural and
incredibly flexible, and JavaScript language design regarding context).

GraphQL also has additional features that can be compared with Prim+RPC such as subscriptions. Subscriptions in GraphQL
allow you to query data and receive multiple updates about that data. In other words, you don't receive a single
response with a subscription but instead multiple responses whenever something changes to that data on the server. This
feature typically uses WebSockets to send data back intermittently without the client polling the server.

In Prim+RPC, you can also "subscribe" to data but instead of defining a separate subscription query, you simply make a
call to a function that uses a callback. Whenever the server uses the callback, the client receives that data. This
functionality is provided over a plugin, typically that uses a WebSocket (but may optionally use some other method of
transfer).

One last feature of GraphQL, or rather an extension of it, is the ability to upload files. This isn't supported by
GraphQL itself but rather is implemented in several tools based on a GraphQL multipart specification that's generally
accepted by the GraphQL community. While it's generally accepted, it's not widely supported and can be difficult to
setup.

In Prim+RPC, the type of data that is supported is totally up to plugins which means that file uploads are generally
supported as long as the plugin being used supports it. In other words, Prim+RPC has already considered file uploads and
how they should be sent over RPC. Once plugins are configured, sending a file over Prim+RPC is as simple as calling a
function with your file as an argument.

To sum up the differences between the two:

| GraphQL                                   | Prim+RPC                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Uses separate SDL to define types         | Uses already-defined types in application       |
| Uses queries and mutations for requests   | Requests are just JavaScript function calls     |
| Uses subscriptions for server-sent events | Server-sent events are received using callbacks |
| File uploads supported by community       | File uploads directly supported with plugins    |
| Supports many languages                   | Server is expected to be JavaScript/TypeScript  |

## Fastify / Express

It is difficult to compare Prim+RPC against an HTTP server framework because they are so different but they can both be
used as some method to send/receive data from a function so the comparison is still relevant.
[Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) are two examples of popular server frameworks
that extend Node's http module. They are used for manually creating API routes with explicit HTTP methods, paths,
headers, and possibly a body. There are various middleware to add almost any kind of functionality that you need to your
server. In fact, these frameworks can be difficult to use without a large stack of middleware.

Prim+RPC does not aim to replace these frameworks. Similar to how frameworks like GraphQL can integrate with frameworks
like Express and Fastify, so can Prim+RPC. Prim+RPC does not come with a default transport mechanism and supports both
Fastify and Express (as well as other HTTP servers) through the use of plugins. This means that you could add Prim+RPC
to your project and use it alongside your existing, defined HTTP routes.

Since Prim+RPC integrates directly with both Fastify and Express (and other servers through plugins), you could register
Prim as middleware for these frameworks and simply give Prim+RPC a function. Prim+RPC will automatically create a route
for your functions. For instance, a request to `/prim/someModule/sayHello?name=Ted` would call a function given to
Prim+RPC like so: `someModule.sayHello({ name: "Ted" })`. Requests sent to Prim+RPC are typically sent as POST requests
(with GET requests available for simple requests, as shown in example) and have simple HTTP status codes already defined
based on whether your function returns (`200`), isn't found (`400`), or throws an error (`500`). This means you do not
have to concern yourself with these various HTTP resources and can use regular JavaScript errors (optionally attaching
codes if needed) without worrying about a whole separate class of HTTP error codes.

You can also access the request context from your server framework using `this` context. For instance, the Fastify
plugin for Prim+RPC will expose the request to your function by binding these variables to your function's `this` object
bound by Prim+RPC. While it's generally encouraged to pass variables as arguments to the function, this functions as an
escape hatch when you need a resource given through your HTTP server (for instance, some existing authentication given
over a cookie, processed by your HTTP server).

Using Prim+RPC with an HTTP server is powerful combo because you can leverage the middleware available in your existing
frameworks but have the simplicity of using Prim+RPC to define resources to be made available over the Internet.

## tRPC

[tRPC](https://github.com/trpc/trpc) is probably most similar to Prim+RPC in terms of the problems that it serves to
address. tRPC and Prim+RPC diverge in how they aim to address them. They are similar in many respects: both are RPC
frameworks, both provide their types over TypeScript, and both are designed to work over multiple types of transports.

One major difference is the focus of the library regarding transport. Both tRPC and Prim+RPC are designed in a way that
they can be used with multiple transports but tRPC tends to focus more on transportation over HTTP (or WebSocket when
using subscriptions). Prim+RPC is built from the start to work well with HTTP/WebSocket but also with IPC meaning you
can use Prim+RPC to bridge not just over networks but over separated processes like Web Workers.

tRPC and Prim+RPC also differ largely in how much library-specific code needs to be written by a developer and also how
much library-specific code is ran when an API is developed with it. If you want to utilize a function in tRPC, you must
write a tRPC procedure defined on tRPC's router which is then passed to the tRPC server instance. This procedure has a
specific shape where you may define the input and output with a schema validation library, usually Zod, and then define
this as either a query or a mutation (concepts for those familiar with GraphQL, which we'll talk about in a minute).

In Prim+RPC, it's just JavaScript. Procedures in tRPC are just regular JavaScript functions in Prim+RPC. Routers in tRPC
are comparable to JavaScript modules. Schema validation in Prim+RPC is left to the developer but, of course, you can
still use Zod in your functions or any other tool from the JavaScript ecosystem.

tRPC has a lot of features that are comparable to GraphQL. It uses familiar GraphQL terms for defining requests which
can be super useful for those migrating from GraphQL to a tool like tRPC. If you're familiar with queries, mutations,
subscriptions, and the like, then tRPC can be an easy tool for which to migrate. However, if you're unfamiliar, these
terms may be daunting and become a hurdle in picking up the framework.

Prim+RPC in contrast does not compare itself to GraphQL but rather to JavaScript. If you know JavaScript then Prim+RPC
should be easy to pick up. Queries in tRPC are simply JavaScript function calls in Prim+RPC, as are mutations.
Subscriptions (messages typically sent over WebSocket) in tRPC are a somewhat more advanced feature of the framework
while in Prim+RPC, they are simply callbacks on a JavaScript function. While tRPC utilizes different methods to define
procedures explicitly on the server, Prim+RPC follows the structure of the JavaScript module that you give it. In other
words, if you give Prim+RPC a module named `someModule` with a function `sayHello` then you'd simply call
`someModule.sayHello()`. No other options are needed for that function call from the client except for those provided
from your function.

tRPC also utilizes Zod to a large extent as a way of defining types that can be enforced during run-time. It also has
tested a few other popular schema libraries and allows them to be used with tRPC. Prim+RPC on the other hand doesn't
have a run-time validation system and only has compile-time validation of types through TypeScript and leaves the
run-time errors to the developer. This means that you could potentially use Zod, just like you would in tRPC, but you
also have the option of choosing any other tool from the JavaScript ecosystem if you'd like.

Another difference between the two is how they are used on the client and within frontend frameworks. tRPC provides an
RPC client with its own fetch client with a variety of features and options built-in. This is useful for getting started
but becomes a problem if you need to use a custom fetch client like Axios or Capacitor's HTTP client.

Prim+RPC's client on the other hand doesn't have a default fetch client. In fact, your method of transport may not be
HTTP so you may not need a fetch client. This functionality in Prim+RPC is provided over plugins so that you can
customize how data is received. This is useful when you need to specify specific details about a connection to a server
or if you need a specific fetch client (for instance, in Ionic Capacitor apps you may need to use the Capacitor HTTP API
instead of the default browser fetch client, which is something that you can do in Prim+RPC by building a plugin).

While tRPC can be used in any UI framework, it provides a React-specific client. Prim+RPC doesn't provide clients for
React or other UI frameworks directly because it's generally not needed. The result of a function call in Prim+RPC's
client is simply a Promise in JavaScript containing your result of the function call. Popular UI frameworks today
usually provide excellent tools for handling Promises so an additional client isn't needed for Prim+RPC.

To sum up differences:

| tRPC                                           | Prim+RPC                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Framework-agnostic but generally HTTP-specific | Transport-agnostic (through plugins), HTTP well supported    |
| Great for those familiar with GraphQL          | Great for those familiar with JavaScript                     |
| Mostly uses Zod for schema validation          | Schema validation is left to developer but Zod could be used |
| Built-in fetch with client                     | Fetching ability provided over plugins                       |

## gRPC

Prim+RPC and [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc) are very different which makes it difficult to accurately compare both
without leaving something out or oversimplifying. However, we'll try to make some general comparisons.

Prim+RPC focuses on JavaScript and takes advantage of JavaScript-specific features. It supports other languages through
the use of simple and easy-to-understand RPCs that can be made over any HTTP client but does not provide clients for
other, specific languages. gRPC on the other hand is intended to be more language-neutral though the usage of protocol
buffers ("protobufs"). While this flexibility can be useful, it does mean that service definitions need to be written in
another language and then implemented in the language of your choice (this is similar to GraphQL in the fact that an
intermediary language is used; in GraphQL it's their SDL, gRPC it's protocol buffers, however they are very different
languages). In Prim+RPC, you only need to use TypeScript to define types without some other intermediary language (or
you could call TypeScript that "intermediary language"). The difference being that TypeScript is written alongside your
code while protocol buffers live outside of it.

gRPC and Prim+RPC also approach data flow differently. gRPC has many different methods to send and receive results from
RPCs including unary/server/client/bidirectional streaming. Prim+RPC does not utilize HTTP/2 streaming or any kind of
transport method because this is specified by plugins. Plugins available by default today do not support HTTP/2
streaming but, of course, you may choose to create a plugin that does (once it's made possible in web browsers).

As a simple comparison (streaming support aside), **unary streaming** in gRPC is comparable to making a simple function
call in Prim+RPC. **Server-side streaming** in gRPC is comparable to adding a callback to your function in Prim+RPC.
**Client-side streaming** and **Bidrectional streaming** methods aren't directly comparable in Prim+RPC. You could
potentially make a comparison by saying that they're similar to using generator functions
([however this is not supported yet](/docs/limitations#generator-functions-are-not-supported-yet)) or maintaining an
open connection using Prim+RPC's callback handler but this isn't a fair comparison so, for simplicity, we'll say that
only unary and server streaming have comparisons with Prim+RPC.

It's also worth noting that only unary and server-side streaming are supported in gRPC's web client as of January 2023,
both of which have comparisons in Prim+RPC (again, we're generalizing here). Even so, they're only supported in web
browsers if you use the Envoy proxy.

Another major difference between the two is that Prim+RPC doesn't require client generation. It instead intercepts the
function calls that you make on a JavaScript Proxy and turns them into RPC. TypeScript types can be used with the client
but they're entirely optional and really only serve to make development easier. In gRPC, the written protocol buffers
need to be converted into code for your specific language and then that resulting client must be used in your code.

In gRPC, authentication has a dedicated, extendable API for authentication that supports both credentials over the
connection and to individual calls. Prim+RPC is in early stages today but can use authentication provided either over a
server-side handler plugin or through RPCs themselves. Using a server-side handler in Prim+RPC, you can integrate with
an existing authentication system defined on that transport. You can either let that transport handle authentication
entirely or pass some of the server context to Prim+RPC to let your RPC calls integrate with authentication on that
server framework. There's also the option of defining authentication as part of your RPC however this would likely
require some token to be passed back and forth (in which case it's recommended to move this to the transport). All of
this said, authentication is a topic that I'm interested in providing better support for in Prim+RPC.

Some general differences are summed up below.

| gRPC                                         | Prim+RPC                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Works with most systems languages            | Great for those familiar with JavaScript                  |
| HTTP/streaming transport                     | Transport-agnostic (provided over plugins)                |
| Built-in authentication API                  | Authentication left to Prim+RPC plugins or function calls |
| Client generation required (using protobufs) | No client generation (import types from server)           |

## JSON RPC

Prim+RPC's structure probably most resembles [JSON RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/). However, it is not JSON RPC and does
not adhere to the standard. Prim+RPC is also not a standard (although it may be standardized before reaching version
1.0) but rather it's a tool for constructing and understanding simple RPCs over JSON. While there are JSON RPC clients
provided by a community of developers, I'm unaware of an official client for it which makes direct comparisons between
the two difficult. Prim+RPC however has an official client.

While JSON RPC and Prim+RPC messages may appear similar at first glance, there are some major differences worth
mentioning. For instance, RPC with Prim+RPC does not require an ID while JSON RPC does (however, it's recommended and
the Prim+RPC will create an ID for its own internal purpose of managing batched requests). Obviously, the `jsonrpc`
property is also missing in Prim+RPC since it is not JSON RPC. Errors in Prim+RPC are also handled differently and
depend entirely on how a thrown Error in JavaScript is serialized (there is no standard). There are no standardized
error codes in Prim+RPC and none are planned while JSON RPC has a few codes intended for RPC-specific errors.

Prim+RPC also has additional features like the ability to receive data from callbacks which has a similar structure to
regular Prim+RPC messages but is formatted slightly different. This feature is not part of JSON RPC. Prim+RPC can also
support file uploads by referencing file IDs in some other object (typically form-data) while file uploads are not a
topic mentioned in JSON RPC.

One last difference between the two is that Prim+RPC does not feature extensions like JSON RPC. It's possible that
Prim+RPC may look to create a standard for its messages in which case features for extending the RPC format may be
considered (like extensions). Today Prim+RPC is still in an early phase and this is something to consider in the future
as Prim+RPC becomes stable.
