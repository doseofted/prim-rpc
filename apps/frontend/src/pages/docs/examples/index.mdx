I've created a few projects to demonstrate various ways that Prim+RPC could be used. It's not an exhaustive list and the
examples are intended to be very simple but they should provide a great reference or even as a starting point for
working with Prim+RPC.

- [Simple Test](https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/examples/01-simple-test)
- [Server/Client Interaction](https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/examples/02-client-server)
- [Web Worker Communication](https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/examples/03-web-worker)
- [Monorepo Setup](https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/examples/04-monorepo)

See the `README.md` files in each example for an overview of the example. Each example is commented thoroughly to
explain each step. You may also follow the guides in the documentation menu of this website for step-by-step guides.
