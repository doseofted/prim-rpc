I've created a few projects to demonstrate various ways that Prim+RPC could be used. It's not an exhaustive list and the
examples are intended to be very simple but they should provide a great reference or even as a starting point for
working with Prim+RPC.

See the `README.md` files in each linked example for an overview. Each example is commented thoroughly to explain each
step. If you only need to see examples of how to use certain features of Prim+RPC, you may also
[read the Usage guide](/docs/usage).

## Table of Contents

## Simple Test

This example demonstrates the simplest usage of Prim+RPC: in a single file as it may be used in a testing environment.

You can download this example with the command below or download
[Simple Test](https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/simple-test) directly.

```zsh
// link[18:1000] https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/simple-test
npx giget@latest gh:doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/simple-test
```

## Server/Client Interaction

This example demonstrates communication between a web server and website in the same project with Prim+RPC.

You can download this example with the command below or download
[Server/Client Interaction](https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/client-server) directly.

```zsh
// link[18:1000] https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/client-server
npx giget@latest gh:doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/client-server
```

## Web Worker Communication

This example demonstrates communication between a web server and web browser in the same project with Prim+RPC.

You can download this example with the command below or download
[Web Worker Communication](https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/web-worker) directly.

```zsh
// link[18:1000] https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/web-worker
npx giget@latest gh:doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/web-worker
```

## Monorepo Setup

This example demonstrates a monolithic repository where a separate JavaScript module is imported by a web server using
Prim+RPC.

You can download this example with the command below or download
[Monorepo Setup](https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/monorepo-setup) directly.

```zsh
// link[18:1000] https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/monorepo-setup
npx giget@latest gh:doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/monorepo-setup
```

## Custom JSON Handler

This example demonstrates a Prim+RPC project where the JSON handler is replaced with an alternative handler.

You can download this example with the command below or download
[Custom JSON Handler](https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/custom-handler) directly.

```zsh
// link[18:1000] https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/custom-handler
npx giget@latest gh:doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/custom-handler
```

## Server Context

This example demonstrates a web server that shares its request context with Prim+RPC.

You can download this example with the command below or download
[Server Context](https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/server-context) directly.

```zsh
// link[18:1000] https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/server-context
npx giget@latest gh:doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/server-context
```

## Fullstack Framework

This example demonstrates Prim+RPC when used in a fullstack framework.

You can download this example with the command below or download
[Fullstack Framework](https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/fullstack-framework) directly.

```zsh
// link[18:1000] https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/fullstack-framework
npx giget@latest gh:doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/fullstack-framework
```
