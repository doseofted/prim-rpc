This is a slightly more advanced guide for those using Prim+RPC outside of JavaScript. **You do not need to read this to
understand how to use Prim+RPC.**

</Alert>

While using Prim+RPC's client to generate RPC is incredibly easy and painless, there may be situations where you would
like to learn how to structure a request to a Prim+RPC server. Maybe you are developing an application with Swift/Kotlin
and need to connect to Prim+RPC from an ordinary HTTP client, maybe you're looking to intercept requests with a Web
Worker for caching, or maybe you are just curious as to how it works.

Before you learn how to format an RPC manually, you should also know that Prim+RPC has a low-level documentation
generator for which you could generate RPC snippets for popular HTTP clients using
[HTTPSnippet](https://github.com/Kong/httpsnippet). These can be customized for your own code being used with Prim+RPC.
This is useful when you have potentially hundreds of different method calls to make. Otherwise, you may just learn how
to make the request yourself since it is designed to be easy to do.

While Prim+RPC only deals with the RPC portion of the request, plugins used with Prim+RPC generally follow a particular
format to deliver that RPC (although they're not technically required to do so). We'll discuss this by working with
typical RPCs that may be sent in Prim+RPC.

## Simple RPC

Let's look at a simple function call and compare it directly against the resulting RPC. We'll define the client and
server in the same file for easier reading. In a real-world scenario, we would use a Prim+RPC plugin but we'll use
testing plugins for example. The focus is only on the `add()` function but if you'd like to test this out, you may copy
the snippet below to see how it actually runs.

```ts index.ts mark=2:5,16:17
import { createPrimClient, createPrimServer, testing } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
// define the function
function add(a: number, b: number) {
	return a + b
}
// assign property "rpc" (otherwise the function isn't allowed to be called remotely)
add.rpc = true
// we'll give Prim RPC Server a module (or a variable resembling a module, like below)
const module = { add }
// create plugins for testing Prim RPC locally (real-world usage may use HTTP/WS plugins)
const { methodHandler, callbackHandler, methodPlugin, callbackPlugin } = testing.createPrimTestingPlugins()
// pass module and plugins to Prim RPC server
const backend = createPrimServer({ module, methodHandler, callbackHandler })
// create a Prim RPC client (and give plugins used to communicate with server)
const frontend = createPrimClient<typeof module>({ methodPlugin, callbackPlugin })
// now make the function call (we can compare this to the expected result, for testing)
const result = await frontend.add(1, 2)
const expected = module.add(1, 2)
console.log(result, result === expected)
```

The function call above, when used with Prim+RPC, would generate the following RPC request and result:

<CH.Code>

```json request.json
{
	"id": "...",
	"method": "add",
	"params": [1, 2]
}
```

---

```json response.json
{
	"id": "...",
	"result": 3
}
```

</CH.Code>

It's that simple! If you were to make this RPC manually, you wouldn't even need to include the "id" property in the
request (this is optional and is used by the Prim+RPC client to sort out batched requests). Depending on how you
send/receive RPC, this result may be wrapped in some other other container, like an HTTP request, but the RPC itself is
contained in this JSON.

We simply gave the method name and arguments to the method then received a result. Our arguments were given as an array
because we have more than one but if we had a single argument (maybe an object), then we would simply need to pass that
argument without wrapping in an array. Let's say we have function like so:

```ts index.ts
/** Alternative version of example above. Notice that there's now a single parameter. */
function add(options: { a: number; b: number }) {
	return options.a + options.b
}
```

When used with Prim+RPC, this would result in the following RPC:

<CH.Code>

```json request.json
{
	"method": "add",
	"params": {
		"a": 1,
		"b": 2
	}
}
```

---

```json response.json
{
	"result": 3
}
```

</CH.Code>

That's about all there is to know about making a simple function call and receiving a result. However, there are
situations where you may not receive a return value back. We'll cover this situation next.

## Handling an Error

Most of the time requests with Prim+RPC will return a result in its RPC contained in the `.result` property of the
response. However, if your function throws an error, then this is no longer the case. When your function errors on the
server, that error is caught, serialized, and forwarded to the client where the error is recreated and thrown for the
client to handle.

Let's take our previous `add()` example and make a small modification:

```ts
function add(a: number, b: number) {
	if (typeof a !== "number") {
		throw "a is not number"
	}
	if (typeof b !== "number") {
		throw "b is not number"
	}
	return a + b
}
```

Given valid input, the RPC result is still the same as it was before. However, if we give an argument of a string, an
error is thrown and the following result is received.

```ts index.ts
try {
	add("not a number", 2)
} catch (error) {
	// error === "a is not number"
}
```

Running this code would result in the following RPC:

<CH.Code>

```json request.json
{
	"method": "add",
	"params": {
		"a": "not a number",
		"b": 2
	}
}
```

---

```json response.json
{
	"error": "a is not number"
}
```

</CH.Code>

The error thrown on the server was serialized and sent to the client on the property `.error` which was then thrown
again on the Prim+RPC client.

You also have the option of throwing an `Error` object which are serialized by default using the library
[serialize-error](https://github.com/sindresorhus/serialize-error). This is the default option in Prim+RPC but can also
be disabled by setting an option in Prim+RPC `handleError` to `false`.
