This is a slightly more advanced guide for those using Prim+RPC outside of JavaScript. **You do not need to read this to
understand how to use Prim+RPC.**

</Alert>

While using Prim+RPC's client to generate RPC is incredibly easy and painless, there may be situations where you would
like to learn how to structure a request to a Prim+RPC server. Maybe you are developing an application with Swift/Kotlin
and need to connect to Prim+RPC from an ordinary HTTP client, maybe you're looking to intercept requests with a Web
Worker for caching, or maybe you are just curious as to how it works.

Before you learn how to format an RPC manually, you should also know that Prim+RPC has a low-level documentation
generator for which you could generate RPC snippets for popular HTTP clients using
[HTTPSnippet](https://github.com/Kong/httpsnippet). These can be customized for your own code being used with Prim+RPC.
This is useful when you have potentially hundreds of different method calls to make. Otherwise, you may just learn how
to make the request yourself since it is designed to be easy to do.

While Prim+RPC only deals with the RPC portion of the request, plugins used with Prim+RPC generally follow a particular
format to deliver that RPC (although they're not technically required to do so). We'll discuss this by working with
typical RPCs that may be sent in Prim+RPC.
