Prim+RPC works over the transport of your choice through the usage of plugins. There are four types of plugins, split
into two categories: a **client plugin** that sends RPC and expect a result, and a **server handler** that receives
given RPC and returns a result.

On both the client and the server, there are two types of plugins/handlers. There are **method handlers** used to send
RPC and receive an immediate RPC result and **callback handlers** which are used to send RPC and await multiple results
over time. Each method _handler_ on the server-side works with the client through a method _plugin_. The same applies to
callbacks: each server-side handler must have a client-side plugin.

For example: if you're already using Express as an HTTP server then you may want to use Prim+RPC with the
[Express method handler](/docs/plugins/server#express) on the server. Since you're using an HTTP server, you'll also
need a client-side plugin that can send and receive HTTP requests. For this purpose, you may use the
[Fetch method plugin](/docs/plugins/client#fetch-api-browser) which uses the web browser's Fetch API to communicate with
your server.

As another example, you may want to support callbacks on your function calls used with Prim+RPC. For this, you'll need a
callback handler. If you are using "ws" (a WebSocket library for Node) then you may use the
[ws callback handler](/docs/plugins/server#ws). You'll also need a corresponding callback plugin on the client. Since
we're using a WebSocket on the server, we'll use the
[WebSocket callback plugin](/docs/plugins/client#websocket-api-browser) which uses the web browser's WebSocket API to
communicate with your server. You may use the method and callback plugins at the same time with Prim+RPC because it will
know when to use one versus the other.

Now that we understand the responsibilities of each plugin/handler, we can determine what type of plugin that we'd like
to create and learn how to create it next.
