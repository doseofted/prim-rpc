# {meta.title}

Prim+RPC has many features built-in and is intended to be very flexible but there are some limitations as to what you
can do with the library. Prim+RPC is intended to allow you to make plain function calls to a server as if that code was
written locally. Since this is not possible with regular JavaScript functions (outside of using RPC, like this library)
there are naturally some limitations to what you can do with functions when used with Prim+RPC.

It is important to understand these limitations since these function calls look like regular JavaScript function calls,
rather than an RPC. It is also suggested that you name your Prim+RPC client something that reminds you that it is RPC.
For instance, you may name your client `backend` so that if you call, for example, `backend.sayHello()` then you know
that this function is provided from your backend service and is subject to these limitations.

There are a few categories of limitations. The first category are limitations due to the fact that Prim+RPC is still
early in development. These are limitations that are intended to be resolved. The second category are serialization
limitations because every RPC must first be serialized before it can be sent. There are ways to extend the types of data
that can be serialized that we'll discuss but some limitations still exist. The third category are limitations in
language support. JavaScript has many features and while Prim+RPC tries to support many, there are some features that
are very difficult to support. I'm hesitant to say impossible to support but some are likely infeasible, at least for
now.

It's important to note that the highest priorities of Prim+RPC is to be functionally on-par with other popular
frameworks like GraphQL or just regular HTTP requests. Supporting every part of the JavaScript language is very, very
difficult and some parts may very well not be possible. The goal is not to support 100% of JavaScript as a language but
rather to communicate limitations clearly.

## Library Usage Notes

These aren't necessarily limitations but are important to point out so that you understand how Prim+RPC works.

### Functions Must Be In An Allow List

Functions used with Prim+RPC must have either: an `.rpc` property assigned a value of `true` or be added to the Prim+RPC
client's [`.allowList`](/docs/reference/configuration#allowlist). This is a restriction added for security so that only
the functions that you explicitly allow to be called are callable from the Prim+RPC server.

```typescript
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"

// this function has an `.rpc` property added
function sayHello() {
	return "Hi!"
}
sayHello.rpc = true

// this function does not have an `.rpc` property
function sayHelloPrivately() {
	return "Hi?"
}

const prim = createPrimClient({
	module: { sayHello, sayHelloPrivately },
})

console.log(await prim.sayHello()) // "Hi!"
try {
	await prim.sayHelloPrivately()
} catch (error) {
	console.log(error) // Method not allowed
}
```

### Function Results Must Be Awaited

When you call a function with the Prim+RPC client, the result of that call will be wrapped in a Promise and must be
awaited, even if the function you're calling doesn't return a Promise. This is because you are fetching this result over
some other channel (in most cases, over HTTP) and this result is not immediately available to you. Prim+RPC sends all
function results back to the client as Promises of the requested data, similar to how you must await a fetch request.

```typescript
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"

/** A random function that returns a string. */
function sayHello() {
	return "Hi!"
}
sayHello.rpc = true

const module = { sayHello }
const prim = createPrimClient({ module })

// function called directly (no Promise)
const resultLocal = module.sayHello()
// function called with client (Promised)
const resultRemote = await prim.sayHello()
```

The results of your function calls on the Prim+RPC client are automatically wrapped in a Promise interface (when using
TypeScript) so that this is made clear in your IDE of choice.

### Callback Results Must Be Awaited

<Alert icon="carbon:warning" type="alert-warning">
	Callback return values are not supported yet but are planned.
</Alert>

Similar to the rule above, callback results on the server must also be awaited. This is because the result is from the
client and is not immediately available.

```typescript
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"

// notice that callback result must be awaited (because result is wrapped in Promise)
async function confirm(onServerConfirm: (message: string) => Promise<boolean> | boolean) {
	const serverConfirmation = await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(true), 1000))
	if (!serverConfirmation) {
		throw "Not confirmed on server!"
	}
	const clientConfirmation = await onServerConfirm("Everything's okay!")
	if (!clientConfirmation) {
		throw "Not confirmed on client!"
	}
	return "<some confirmed value>"
}
confirm.rpc = true

const prim = createPrimClient({
	module: { confirm },
})

const confirmed = await prim.confirm(message => {
	console.log(message) // "Everything's okay!"
	return true
})
console.log(confirmed) // "<some confirmed value>"
```

Prim+RPC automatically wraps this data in a Promise. You should assume in your function's type definitions, if using
TypeScript, that the result of your callback may or may not be wrapped in a Promise.

## Serialization Limitations

RPC messages need to be serialized before they are transported. Simple primitive types are always supported but
additional types may require a separate serialization library or manual work to deserialize data on the server.

### Default JSON Serialization

Since Prim+RPC messages are JSON, the default JSON handler is used with special handling of callbacks, files, and Error
objects. However, this is subject to the limitations of the default JSON handler. This means that other types of data
will need to be serialized to a string and will not automatically convert back to the same type on the server. If the
data type passed to Prim+RPC is not something that can be serialized then it may not be sent at all.

However, you can change the JSON serialization library used to extend the number of types that can be serialized and add
more. This way your types from the client that you pass to the server will be preserved on the server without having to
manually deserialize that data.

### Extending JSON Serialization

You may choose to use a library like [superjson](https://github.com/blitz-js/superjson) to extend the types that can be
used automatically with Prim+RPC. Prim+RPC supports custom JSON handlers like this and many others as long as they
provide a `stringify` and `parse` method.

It is important to know that if JSON serialization is extended, you must do so on both the server and client (since
serialization and deserialzation go hand-in-hand) You can configure it like so:

<CH.Code>

```ts client.ts
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import jsonHandler from "superjson"

const client = createPrimClient<typeof exampleClient>({
	jsonHandler,
	// ... other client options
})
```

---

```ts server.ts
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import jsonHandler from "superjson"

const server = createPrimServer({
	jsonHandler,
	// ... other server options
})
```

</CH.Code>

It's important to note that if a public API is built with Prim+RPC that not everyone can use a custom JSON handler (for
instance, if a request is made outside of a JavaScript environment). In these situations, you can create two Prim+RPC
servers referencing the same module: one that supports a custom JSON handler and one that does not. In these situations,
you'll need to handle serialization when someone makes a request using the default JSON handler from the client (you
may, for example, use a framework like [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for preprocessing or type coercion).

## Prerelease Limitations

These are issues that I hope to resolve. Many of these depend on me finding creative solutions to these problems which
makes creating a timeline for these issues difficult.

### Server Cannot Curry to Client Yet

Today, Prim+RPC supports many types of return values and even more by using a custom JSON serialization library with
Prim+RPC. It even supports calling a client-defined callback based on server events. However today, a function returned
a function call on the server cannot be called from the client.

```ts
// NOTE: DOES NOT WORK
export function add(a: number) {
	return function (b: number) {
		a + b
	}
}
```

This may be fixed by storing a function reference on the server while a WebSocket (or other transport) connection is
open and then once the returned function on the client is called, sending a new WebSocket message with a reference to
that temporary function.

This becomes complicated when you consider that these functions could be passed a file parameter or a callback
themselves, when they're not directly accessible except for during the WebSocket session. This may be difficult to
support and may involve adding a new limitation that returned functions cannot have files/callbacks themselves.

### Callbacks Cannot Return Value to Client Yet

You can pass callbacks to functions defined on a server used with Prim+RPC. These callbacks can be called from the
server and the client's callback will receive the parameters from the server. However, if the client returns a value
from this callback, the server cannot receive that information yet.

```typescript
// NOTE: DOES NOT WORK
export function doSomething(askApproval: (status: string) => Promise<boolean>) {
	const acknowledged = await askApproval("ready")
	if (acknowledged) {
		// ... do something
	}
}
```

I believe that this can be solved but there may be an additional limitation needed so that a callback cannot return yet
another function (otherwise this is another problem that needs to be solved).

### Files Cannot Be Sent as Response to RPC Yet

Today, Prim+RPC can handle file uploads to the server but cannot return a file from the server back to the client. To be
clear, you can return a URL to the client over RPC that points to a file (this is typical with many server-side APIs)
but you cannot return the binary contents of that file back to the function yet.

```ts
// NOTE: DOES NOT WORK
export function createCalendarEvent(date: Date) {
	const calendarInviteFile: Buffer = createICSFile()
	return calendarInviteFile
}
```

### Callbacks and Files Can't Be Used At Same Time

Today, Prim+RPC can support both callbacks and files as parameters. However, it cannot support both at the same time.
This is due to the fact that they require different methods of transport today. Callbacks require a "callback handler"
plugin (typically a WebSocket connection to maintain the callback reference) while files require a "method handler"
plugin (typically an HTTP client that uses "form-data" to upload the file).

```ts
// NOTE: DOES NOT WORK
export function uploadFileWithProgress(file: Promise<Buffer>, receivedCallback: () => void) {
	const downloaded = await file
	receivedCallback()
}
```

The solution is to allow file uploads over the "callback handler" since callbacks require some session to be established
which isn't possible over the "method handler" (this is primarily why there are two handlers, for callbacks and
methods). The problem is that there is no "form-data" standard/library over WebSocket without creating one myself.
Instead, RPC would need to be sent over one message and another message (potentially, multiple messages) would need to
contain binary data. This would then need to be pieced together on the server. That's a lot of work and falls outside of
Prim+RPC's responsibilities. I will need to find time to address this issue, find some other solution, or consider
making this a permanent limitation.

### Generator Functions are Not Supported Yet

[Generator functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*) can be
incredibly useful but do not appear to be a very popular feature in JavaScript yet. Generator functions are not yet
supported yet in Prim+RPC today. It is possible that they may be supported in the future in a similar way that callbacks
are supported but today this feature is unavailable. As Prim+RPC progresses, this feature is something that I'd like to
look into further to ensure that it's possible (Prim+RPC is in early stages).

```ts
// NOTE: DOES NOT WORK
export function* aloha() {
	yield "Hello!"
	yield "Goodbye!"
}

for (const greeting of aloha()) {
	console.log(greeting)
}
```

### Function Context is set by Prim+RPC

Prim+RPC today sets the context of your function (the `this` variable ) based on the server-side handler used. This
behavior is used to allow transport-specific mechanisms to be used where necessary (for instance, this could be useful
for using existing authentication over an HTTP framework). Since the `this` object is set from the handler plugin, this
means that functions used with Prim+RPC cannot set the `this` without it being overridden by the calling function. This
should generally be expected in JavaScript since the value of the `this` variable is determined by the calling function
(Prim+RPC in this case) but may be confusing if a method is given from an instantiated class.

```typescript
// NOTE: this DOES work (just remember to set the correct context used with your chosen server)
export function getCustomHeader(this: PrimFastifyContext) {
	console.log(`Header provided over ${this.context}`, this.headers["x-my-custom-header"])
}

// NOTE: DOES NOT WORK
class Test {
	someProperty = "hello!"

	hello() {
		console.log(this.someProperty)
	}
}
const testInstance = new Test()
export { testInstance }

// NOTE: this DOES work
function hello() {
	return testInstance.hello()
}
hello.rpc = true
```

In the above example, `getCustomHeader()` would work if used with a server framework that provides headers (using
Fastify as an example). This is because we expect Prim+RPC to set this context when calling the function.

However calling `testInstance.hello()` with the Prim+RPC client would log `undefined` instead of the expected `"hello!"`
because Prim+RPC set the `this` value to another value, where the logged `.someProperty` doesn't exist.

If we wrap this instance's method in another function, `hello()`, we will see `"hello!"` logged because the `this`
context of `testInstance.hello()` was not changed.

<Alert prose icon="carbon:information">

This is the default behavior today but this may be changed before a 1.0 release if found that this functionality is more
of a hurdle than a helpful utility.
