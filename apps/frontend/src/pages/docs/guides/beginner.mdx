To get going and show off what Prim+RPC can do, we'll set up two JavaScript environments that can't directly communicate
with each other: a web server and a website. Our web server will use Deno and our website will use basic HTML and
JavaScript.

This guide will assume that you have a basic knowledge of JavaScript and some HTML but you do not have to be an expert
to follow this guide. If you are looking for a more in-depth guide, you may consider the Intermediate or Experienced
guides.
