In this guide, we'll learn how to set up an existing project to use Prim+RPC. If you'd like to set up a new project, you
may follow the guides or explore one of the example projects on this website.

## Installation

We will be setting up Prim+RPC on both the **server** and the **client**.

The server is where your JavaScript functions are located; functions that you'd like to share with someone else. The
client will call these JavaScript functions remotely. Typically the server is some HTTP or WebSocket server and the
client is a web browser or native application that makes requests to this server. In other cases, the server may be
running in one process while the client is running in a separate process on the same machine. However you're using up
Prim+RPC, this guide should apply to all relationships between client and server.

The first step to use Prim+RPC will be to add the library to both the server and client portions of your project. If
your client and server are located in separate projects, you should install the following packages in both:

- **Prim+RPC**: contains both client and server tools for making RPC; framework-agnostic
- **Prim+Plugins**: framework-specific plugins for Prim+RPC, both client and server side

Provided are installation commands for common package managers.

<CH.Code>

```zsh npm
npm install @doseofted/prim-rpc @doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins
```

```zsh yarn
yarn add @doseofted/prim-rpc @doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins
```

```zsh pnpm
pnpm install @doseofted/prim-rpc @doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins
```

</CH.Code>

You may also use Prim+RPC from a CDN:

<CH.Code>

```ts esm.sh
import { /** choose imports */ } "https://esm.sh/@doseofted/prim-rpc";
import { /** choose imports */ } "https://esm.sh/@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins";
```

```ts skypack.dev
import { /** choose imports */ } "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { /** choose imports */ } "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins"
```

```ts unpkg.com
import { /** choose imports */ } "https://unpkg.com/@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { /** choose imports */ } "https://unpkg.com/@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins"
```

</CH.Code>

Now you're ready to start setting up the client and the server! I've created some guides to help you set up both client
and server and to show what is possible with Prim+RPC. These are available in the website's navigation.

If you're already familiar with Prim+RPC or don't have time to follow a guide, I'll describe below the steps that you
should follow to set up your existing client and server projects with Prim+RPC. If you don't already have a client and
serer configured, I recommend that you follow on of the guides on this website.

We'll separate client/server steps and start with the server first.
