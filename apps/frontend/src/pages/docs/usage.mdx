If you know a little JavaScript then you know how to use Prim+RPC. In this guide, we'll outline the features of Prim+RPC
and give examples of how to use them.

It is assumed that you have already set up the Prim+RPC client and server. If you have not yet then you may
[follow the setup guide](/docs/setup) before continuing. The following are partial examples that demonstrate each
selected feature. We'll be working out of an imaginary file called `example.ts` (a TypeScript file but feel free to use
regular JavaScript). For example's sake, we'll assume that this file is imported and used with Prim+RPC like so:

<CH.Code>

```typescript index.ts
import { createPrimClient, createPrimServer, testing } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import * as module from "./example"

const plugins = testing.createPrimTestingPlugins()

const { callbackHandler, methodHandler } = plugins
const server = createPrimServer({ module, callbackHandler, methodHandler })

const { methodPlugin, callbackPlugin } = plugins
const client = createPrimClient({ callbackPlugin, methodPlugin })
```

```typescript example.ts
// We've not created any functions yet!
export {}
```

</CH.Code>

Of course, if you'd like to follow along then you can use any plugins that you'd like. The following examples will
modify the module given in `example.ts`.

It's also worth noting that this guide is only meant to demonstrate usage of functions with Prim+RPC. You can find more
features available with the Prim+RPC server and client by checking the
[configuration reference](/docs/reference/configuration).

## Table of Contents

## Call a Function

You can create a regular JavaScript function and use that directly with Prim+RPC. Remember to add the `.rpc` property to
the function to tell Prim+RPC that it is allowed to be called. Also remember that the function result is wrapped in a
Promise and must be awaited (because we must await a response from the server).

<CH.Code>

```typescript example.ts
/** Say hello! */
export function sayHello(name: string) {
	return `Hello ${name ?? "you"}!`
}
sayHello.rpc = true
```

---

```typescript index.ts
// ...client defined earlier
const greeting = await client.sayHello("Ted")
console.log(greeting) // "Hello Ted!"
```

</CH.Code>

By default, Prim+PRC can accept all types supported by JSON. These can be extended by using a custom JSON handler as
seen [in the next example](#pass-advanced-arguments).

<Alert prose icon="carbon:information">

Prim+RPC should be configured with a [`.methodHandler`](/docs/reference/configuration#methodhandler) on the server and a
[`.methodPlugin`](/docs/reference/configuration#methodplugin) on the client for method calls to work.

</Alert>

## Pass Advanced Arguments

If you've [set up a custom JSON handler](/docs/reference/configuration#jsonhandler) then you can even use other
non-primitive types like Dates directly with Prim+RPC!

<CH.Code>

```typescript example.ts
/** Probably tomorrow. */
export function whatIsDayAfter(day: Date) {
	return new Date(day.valueOf() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
}
whatIsDayAfter.rpc = true
```

---

```typescript index.ts
// ...client defined earlier
const result = await client.whatIsDayAfter(new Date())
console.log(result) // (a Date object)
```

</CH.Code>

You can also [pass callbacks](#use-a-callback) and [files](#upload-files) to functions!

## Throw an Error

If a function that you define on the server throws an error, that same error can be thrown on the client (as long as
[`.handleError`](/docs/reference/configuration#handleerror) option is `true`).

<CH.Code>

```typescript example.ts
/** Whoopsie */
export function oops(ok = false) {
	if (!ok) {
		throw new Error("My bad.")
	}
	return "I did it again."
}
oops.rpc = true
```

---

```typescript index.ts
// ...client defined earlier
try {
	const result = await client.oops()
} catch (error) {
	if (error instanceof Error) {
		console.log(error.message) // "My bad."
	}
}
```

</CH.Code>

## Use a Callback

Functions used with Prim+RPC can accept callbacks. This is useful for listening to events on the server as they happen
without having to poll the server at a set interval.

<CH.Code>

```typescript example.ts
/** Type a message. Now with configurable type speed. */
export function typeMessage(message: string, typeLetter: (typed: string) => void, speed = 300) {
	let timeout = 0
	message.split("").forEach(letter => {
		setTimeout(() => typeLetter(letter), ++timeout * speed)
	})
}
typeMessage.rpc = true
```

---

```typescript index.ts
// ...client defined earlier
await client.typeMessage("Hello!", letter => {
	console.log(letter) // each letter of "Hello!"
})
```

</CH.Code>

<Alert prose icon="carbon:information">

Prim+RPC should be configured with a [`.callbackHandler`](/docs/reference/configuration#callbackhandler) on the server
and a [`.callbackPlugin`](/docs/reference/configuration#callbackplugin) on the client for callbacks to work.

</Alert>

## Use Multiple Signatures

As you'll see in the next few examples, you can use multiple signatures on a function when using TypeScript. This is
useful when accepting file uploads or uploading an HTML form where the type on the client is not the same as or is
unavailable on the server.

<CH.Code>

```typescript example.ts
/** Add two numbers together. Strings are converted to numbers automatically. */
export function add(x: string, y: string): number
/** Add two numbers together. */
export function add(x: number, y: number): number

export function add(x: number | string, y: number | string) {
	return Number(x) + Number(y)
}
add.rpc = true
```

---

```typescript index.ts
// ...client defined earlier

const result1 = await client.add(5, 5)
const result2 = await client.add("7", "3")
console.log(result1, result1 === result2) // 10, true
```

</CH.Code>

## Upload Files

You can upload files to Prim+RPC as long as your configured
[`.methodHandler`](/docs/reference/configuration#methodhandler) supports it. Files (and Blobs) can be sent like so:

<CH.Code>

```typescript example.ts
import fs from "node:fs/promises"

/** TypeScript/server utility to ensure given argument is of type T */
const server = <T>(given: unknown): given is T => typeof window === "undefined"

/** Upload a file to the server */
export function uploadFile(someTextFile: File): void
export function uploadFile(someTextFile: Promise<string>): void
export function uploadFile(someTextFile: unknown) {
	if (!server<Promise<string>>(inputs)) {
		return
	}
	const text = await fs.readFile(await someTextFile, "utf-8")
	console.log("File contents:", text)
}
uploadFile.rpc = true
```

---

```typescript index.ts
// ...client defined earlier

const file = new File(["Hello from client!"], "hello.txt", { type: "text/plain" })
await client.uploadFile(file) // server will log contents of file
```

</CH.Code>

This function has two function signatures (when using TypeScript). The first signature is for the browser where the
client will provide a File. On the server, a Prim+RPC plugin will read the file, save it to a temporary location, and
then pass the location of the file back to the function wrapped in a Promise (since uploading the file from the client
isn't immediate).

<Alert prose icon="carbon:information">

The current file-handling behavior of method handlers may be changed in the future to support Buffers or (possibly)
Streams. Prim+RPC is in early stages.

</Alert>

## Pass a Form Directly

If you have an HTML form on the page, you can pass that Form element directly to Prim+RPC. The Prim+RPC client will read
the FormData given on the form and turn it into an object (preserving any files given on the Form) that will be sent to
the server.

<CH.Code>

```typescript example.ts
interface FormInputs {
	name: string
	email: string
	message: string
}

/** TypeScript/server utility to ensure given argument is of type T */
const server = <T>(given: unknown): given is T => typeof window === "undefined"

/** Submit a contact form */
export function submitContactForm(form: HTMLFormElement | FormData): string
export function submitContactForm(inputs: FormInputs): string
export function submitContactForm(inputs: unknown) {
	if (!server<FormInputs>(inputs)) {
		return
	}
	const { name, message, email } = inputs
	console.log("Details to be sent somewhere:", { name, message, email })
	return `Thank you for your message, ${name}!`
}
submitContactForm.rpc = true
```

---

```typescript index.ts
// ...client defined earlier

const form = document.getElementById("my-html-form") as HTMLFormElement
const thankYouMessage = await client.submitContactForm(form)
console.log(thankYouMessage) // `Thank you for your message, Ted!`
```

</CH.Code>

It's assumed that the HTML form used in this example has three text/email inputs named `name`, `email`, and `message`.

Note that we defined a function signature in TypeScript intended for the browser (accepting a `HTMLFormElement`) and the
function signature for the server is an object with the names of the given inputs (`FormInputs`).

## Use Nested Modules

Functions don't have to be located at the top of your module in Prim+RPC. You can use nested modules like so:

<CH.Code>

```typescript example.ts
/** Say hello! */
function sayHello(name: string) {
	return `Hello ${name ?? "you"}!`
}
sayHello.rpc = true

const moduleLike = {
	i: {
		would: {
			like: {
				to: {
					sayHello
				}
			}
		}
	}
}

export moduleLike
```

---

```typescript index.ts
// ...client defined earlier
const greeting = await client.i.would.like.to.sayHello("Ted")
console.log(greeting) // "Hello Ted!"
```

</CH.Code>

## Use Server Context

You can set the context of the function based on the utilized method and callback handlers. Each handler used with
Prim+RPC will have its own context (for instance, a Request object in some server framework). This context can be
accessed from the function's `this` object (Prim+RPC will bind that context to the function).

You may override this context or limit what is bound to functions by setting the `.contextTransform` option, if
available, on the given handler.

<CH.Code>

```typescript example.ts
/** Perform action on server if logged in */
export function performAdministrativeAction(this: PrimFastifyContext) {
	let allowed = false
	if (this.cookie.authorized) {
		allowed = true
	}
	return allowed ? "You're in!" : "Oops! Try again."
}
performAdministrativeAction.rpc = true
```

---

```typescript index.ts
// ...client defined earlier

// we'll pretend that we're already authorized
const message = await client.performAdministrativeAction()
console.log(message) // "You're in!"
```

</CH.Code>
