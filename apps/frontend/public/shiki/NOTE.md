Some of the files in this folder can be hard to find. I've made note of these below:

- [TypeScript TextMate Grammer JSON](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-typescript-next/blob/main/syntaxes/TypeScript.tmLanguage.json) used under the MIT license. I believe this JSON was built from [TypeScript-TmLanguage](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage) (also MIT).
- [Bearded Theme (Monokai Stone)](https://github.com/BeardedBear/bearded-theme/blob/master/themes/bearded-theme-monokai-stone.json) used under MIT.
- [VS Code Oniguruma](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-oniguruma/blob/main/out/onig.wasm) used under MIT.
