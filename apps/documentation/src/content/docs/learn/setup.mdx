Prim+RPC bridges two separated environments: the server, where your functions are located, and the client, where those
functions are called. The server may be a literal HTTP server or could be some other environment like a Web Worker.
Prim+RPC is able to work in all of these environments because of its plugin system.

More importantly, it makes communication between server and client actually easy. Functions are functions, server and
client, you define it and call it. Done. Prim+RPC handles the dance.

Prim+RPC has two types of plugins, each with a version for the server and client. **Method plugins** handle calls to
methods. **Callback plugins** optionally handle callbacks on those methods. Plugins used on the server are referred to
as **handlers** to easily differentiate server/client.

Today, we'll set up a method handler to receive method calls over the Fetch API on the server. On the client, we'll set
up a method plugin to to call those methods using the Fetch API.

## Starter Project

We'll use a starter project to get up and running quickly. You may clone the starter project with the following command,
or [download directly](https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/starter).

<CodeFile>

```zsh
npx giget@latest gh:doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/starter prim-rpc-examples/starter
cd prim-rpc-examples/starter
```

</CodeFile>

You may also open the starter project in StackBlitz:

[![Open in StackBlitz](/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/starter)

See the project's `README.md{:txt}` file to learn how the project is configured. For this guide we'll use the
[pnpm package manager](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm#readme) but you may choose to use any runtime or package manager
that you like.

Run `pnpm dev{:zsh}` to start the project. A browser window will open that says **"Not implemented"**.

Let's implement it!

## Installation

Prim+RPC is composed of multiple packages, in order: the **core** RPC functionality, **plugins** for it, and optional
**tooling**. You may find install commands for your package manager or runtime below.

<Aside>
	If you're using the starter project, you can skip this step: Prim+RPC is already installed in both server and client
	parts of the project.
</Aside>

These packages should be installed on both server and client portions of your project.

	}
}
```

## Server Setup

First, we need some function to call on the server. Let's start with something simple:

<CodeFile filename="server/module.ts">

```typescript
export function sayHello(x = "Backend", y = "Frontend") {
	return `${x}, meet ${y}.`
}
sayHello.rpc = true
```

</CodeFile>

The `rpc` property here signals to Prim+RPC that it can safely call this function. Functions are objects in JavaScript
so if this looks unfamiliar, this is perfectly valid code.

Now let's set up the Prim+RPC server and pass our function to it:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeFile filename="server/index.ts">

```typescript
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import * as module from "./module"

const prim = createPrimServer({ module })

export type Module = typeof module

```

</CodeFile>

Note that we exported the module's type. This is optional but can make for an easier development experience when shared
with the client (either locally or by uploading types only to a registry).

The Prim+RPC server is now configured however it doesn't do much alone. Prim+RPC depends on plugins that transform
requests into a form that it understands.

Let's expose our function over HTTP using the Fetch API:

<CodeFile filename="server/index.ts">

```typescript {2,6}
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { primFetch } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/server-fetch"
import * as module from "./module"

const prim = createPrimServer({ module })
const fetch = primFetch({ prim })

export type Module = typeof module

```

</CodeFile>

In Deno and Bun runtimes, this will work out of the box by utilizing the created `fetch` object. In Node, we'll need to
install an adapter called `@whatwg-node/server{:txt}` (if using the starter project, this is already installed):

<CodeFile>

```zsh
pnpm add @whatwg-node/server
```

</CodeFile>

Now we can set up the fetch handler in Node, just like other runtimes:

<CodeFile filename="server/index.ts">

```typescript {4-5,10-12}
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { primFetch } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/server-fetch"
import * as module from "./module"
import { createServer } from "node:http"
import { createServerAdapter } from "@whatwg-node/server"

const prim = createPrimServer({ module })
const fetch = primFetch({ prim })

const fetchAdapter = createServerAdapter(fetch)
const server = createServer(fetchAdapter).listen(3000)
console.log("Prim+RPC is available at http://localhost:3000/prim")

export type Module = typeof module

```

</CodeFile>

We can now make requests to the server! We haven't set up the client yet but we can still try it out. Requests in
Prim+RPC are typically made over POST but for demo's sake:

<CodeFile>

```zsh
curl --request GET --url "http://localhost:3000/prim/sayHello?0=Backend&1=Terminal"
```

</CodeFile>

We'll be calling this function from a web browser next. This means that we'll need to
[implement CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS) so that the client is allowed to call the
server. We can configure this in the Fetch handler's options:

<CodeFile filename="server/index.ts">

```typescript {8-11} /postprocess/2
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { primFetch } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/server-fetch"
import * as module from "./module"
import { createServer } from "node:http"
import { createServerAdapter } from "@whatwg-node/server"

const prim = createPrimServer({ module })
function postprocess(res: Response) {
	res.headers.set("access-control-allow-origin", "http://localhost:5173")
	res.headers.set("access-control-allow-headers", "content-type")
}
const fetch = primFetch({ prim, postprocess })

const fetchAdapter = createServerAdapter(fetch)
const server = createServer(fetchAdapter).listen(3000)
console.log("Prim+RPC is available at http://localhost:3000/prim")

export type Module = typeof module

```

</CodeFile>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

This will allow our client, which will run on `http://localhost:5173{:txt}`, to call the server. Our server is fully
configured and we can now set up the client!

## Client Setup

Now that the server can receive function calls, we'll need a client that knows how to interact with the server. Let's
set that up now. We'll start off with the following:

<CodeFile filename="client/prim.ts">

```typescript
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import type { Module } from "../server"

const prim = createPrimClient<Module>()
```

</CodeFile>

We have set up the client and passed the type parameter from the server to get type definitions. Like the server, the
client doesn't do anything by itself. It needs compatible plugins to work with the server.

Let's set up our method plugin next. This plugin will utilize the browser's Fetch API under the hood:

<CodeFile filename="client/prim.ts">

```typescript {2,6-7}
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { createMethodPlugin } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/browser-fetch"
import type { Module } from "../server"

export default createPrimClient<Module>({
	endpoint: "http://localhost:3000/prim",
	methodPlugin: createMethodPlugin(),
})
```

</CodeFile>

We have passed the server's address, from the last step, to the client and told the Prim+RPC client to send an HTTP
request containing the function call to the server.

Prim+RPC is now set up and ready to use! Try making a function call:

<CodeFile filename="client/index.ts">

```typescript
import client from "./prim"

const greeting = await client.sayHello()
console.log(greeting) // "Frontend, meet Backend."
```

</CodeFile>

Now we can see our message logged to the developer's console. Let's replace the **"Not implemented"** message on the
page with our greeting:

<CodeFile filename="client/index.ts">

```typescript {6-7}
import { client } from "./prim"

const greeting = await client.sayHello()
console.log(greeting) // "Frontend, meet Backend."

const app = document.getElementById("app")
if (app) app.innerText = greeting
```

</CodeFile>

Now we can easily add more functions on the server and simply call those functions from the client.

## Next Steps

While we could stop right here, Prim+RPC can do much more. See the [advanced guide](/docs/learn/advanced) to continue on
and send and receive Files, work with callbacks, and work with more types.
