It can sometimes be difficult to understand how a new tool fits in your existing toolchain. How is it used with another
framework? Does it replace other libraries? What is the difference between them? Let's look through some popular tools
today so that we can better understand what Prim+RPC is and how it can be used.

<Aside>

The purpose of this page is to show how Prim+RPC compares to and integrates with other tools, not to dissuade usage of
other tools.

## GraphQL

GraphQL is a form of RPC with its own querying language and types. It is a specification implemented in many programming
languages and frameworks. It defines several operations to interact with data: queries to retrieve data, mutations to
change data, and subscriptions to react to events on the server.

Prim+RPC is an RPC library that uses JavaScript as the query language. It does not define operations, instead data is
retrieved by calling a defined function. Since it takes advantage of JavaScript as a language, the server and client are
expected to be JavaScript however RPC requests are simple to make from other languages.

As a high-level overview, here is a summary of notable differences:

| GraphQL                                                 | Prim+RPC                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Has its own query language                              | JavaScript is the query language: it doesn't have one   |
| Types defined using their SDL                           | Existing types (TypeScript/JSDoc) are utilized          |
| Validation based on types                               | Validation is provided by developer                     |
| Provides queries to get data                            | Function call retrieves data                            |
| Provides mutations to change data                       | Function call changes data                              |
| Server updates given as subscriptions                   | Callbacks on functions receives server updates          |
| Files uploads given by community-provided specification | Files can be passed to function                         |
| File downloads unsupported                              | Files can be returned from function                     |
| Servers supports many languages                         | Server is expected to be JavaScript                     |
| Clients supports many languages                         | Client is JavaScript but can be made in other languages |

## tRPC

tRPC is an RPC library for JavaScript/TypeScript using many concepts from GraphQL but taking advantage of validation
frameworks like Zod to both validate queries and mutations and also to provide static type safety. While backend
implementations can be changed, it is typically used with HTTP servers and has several adapters available. The client
generally sends HTTP requests but this can be changed with a custom "terminating link."

Prim+RPC is also an RPC library for JavaScript but does not compare itself with GraphQL but rather with JavaScript.
Queries and mutations in tRPC are just function calls. Subscriptions are simply callbacks on functions. It's also
runtime and framework agnostic: it works over HTTP but also over WebSocket, Web Workers, or any other transport through
plugins. Prim+RPC also provides type safety through TypeScript but leaves validation to the developer in the defined
functions.

Both libraries have features such as custom serialization, batching support, ability to "subscribe" to server updates,
ability to pass server context to RPC library, among other features. A summary of notable differences:

| tRPC                                                  | Prim+RPC                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Borrows terminology from GraphQL                      | Compares itself to JavaScript                     |
| Generally intended for HTTP but can be used elsewhere | Transport agnostic but supports HTTP              |
| Uses queries and mutations defined on a router        | Uses functions defined a module                   |
| Uses subscriptions for server updates                 | Callbacks on functions receive server updates     |
| Does not yet support file uploads or downloads        | Files can be passed to and returned from function |

## Data Loaders

Data loaders is a concept that's become popular with fullstack frameworks like Qwik, Next.js, Remix, and others. It is
auto-generated RPC, created as part of a compile step, allowing server-side code to be written inside of and extracted
from client-side code. This is generally used to transform data only available on the server into a format expected by
UI components on the client but could potentially be used to create a client-specific API.

Prim+RPC auto-generates RPC as well but requests are inferred at runtime, without a compilation step. Server-side code
is intended to be written separately from client-side code, by design. Since RPC is not extracted from code, there is no
auto-generation of function names or routes: they are given by the name of your functions. There is also less risk of
accidentally exposing server-side code to the client since client and server are separate and only types are shared.

As for how they may fit together: Prim+RPC is intended to write a full server API while data loaders are commonly used
to transform data from a server's API into a format expected by the client.

| Data Loaders                                     | Prim+RPC                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| RPC created during compilation                   | RPC inferred at runtime                               |
| Usually used to transform data from API to UI    | Used to create a full server API                      |
| Server code exists inside of client code         | Server and client are separate                        |
| Server utilities specific to given framework     | Works with server of your choice                      |
| Type support limited to those given in framework | Type support can be extended with custom JSON handler |

## gRPC

gRPC is a form of RPC based around Protocol Buffers ("protobufs") designed to work with many languages by creating a
schema and implementing that schema with the server of your choice and connecting to the server with a compiled client
which can be used in various programming languages. It provides many transport options such as unary, server-side,
client-side, and bidirectional streaming, and has options for authentication.

Prim+RPC on the other hand is intended for JavaScript and does not utilize a schema language. It instead infers
information from the module provided to Prim+RPC. It also does not require a compiled client since the client will
simply intercept calls and turn that into RPC. In terms of transport, Prim+RPC supports options comparable to unary and
server-side streaming. Authentication is not provided with Prim+RPC but can be implemented by handing server context to
Prim+RPC.

| gRPC                                    | Prim+RPC                                                |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Server implements given specification   | No specification required, inferred from module         |
| Client compiled from specification      | No client generation, uses JavaScript                   |
| Supports many languages                 | Intended for and takes advantage of JavaScript features |
| Unary streaming                         | Function call                                           |
| Server-side streaming                   | Callbacks on functions                                  |
| Client-side and bidirectional streaming | No comparable options                                   |

## JSON RPC

JSON RPC is an RPC specification based on JSON. It is a lightweight protocol and implementations vary widely. There are
many implementations available in many languages but the underlying specification is fairly simple. It allows methods to
be called and results received as either a result or an error. It also includes an option for batching requests. Many
implementations support these basic features and may add additional features.

Prim+RPC supports all of JSON RPC's features and many more. While the underlying RPC structures appear similar, Prim+RPC
is not based on JSON RPC and covers features that don't have equivalents in JSON RPC like callback support and file
uploads. It has one implementation and it is both runtime and framework agnostic.

| JSON RPC                                    | Prim+RPC                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Lightweight specification based on JSON     | Framework built around JavaScript language using JSON |
| Many implementations available              | One implementation, framework-agnostic                |
| Implementations available in many languages | Supports JavaScript and TypeScript                    |
| Supports JSON types only                    | Serialization library can be swapped out              |
| No file support officially                  | Files can be uploaded and downloaded with plugins     |
