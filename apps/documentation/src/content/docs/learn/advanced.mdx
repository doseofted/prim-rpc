## Add Validation

Prim+RPC validates RPC sent to the server but does not validate arguments and return types by default: this is up to the
developer. When using Prim+RPC over the internet it is important to validate user input. We can validate data in our
functions easily though.

We can use any validation framework that we like but, for example, we'll choose a popular framework: Zod. Let's install
it on the server:

<CodeFile>

```zsh
cd server
pnpm add zod
```

</CodeFile>

Now let's modify our function on the server to overwrite and validate our arguments:

<CodeFile filename="server/module.ts">

```typescript {1,4} /x?: string/ /y?: string/
import { z } from "zod"

export function sayHello(x = "Backend", y = "Frontend") {
	;[x, y] = z.tuple([z.string(), z.string()]).parse([x, y])
	return `${x}, meet ${y}.`
}
sayHello.rpc = true
```

</CodeFile>

Now we can ensure that our arguments are strings. We could also validate the return value, use multiple validation
libraries, or skip validation if needed. Since validation is part of function logic it is up to you.

<Aside>

There are several options to add validation to Prim+RPC, not mentioned here. See the
[Security guide to learn more](/docs/learn/security#validate-arguments).

</Aside>

## File Support

Prim+RPC supports passing Files and Blobs as part of a function's arguments and returning Files and Blobs as a function
result. With the Fetch API, we don't even need to set up anything additional. **It works out of the box!**

Let's try this out. First, we'll create a function that returns a File. As a demo, we'll write a function that takes a
Markdown file and returns an HTML file. We'll use a library called
[micromark](https://github.com/micromark/micromark#readme) for this.

<CodeFile>

```zsh
cd server
pnpm add micromark
```

</CodeFile>

Replace the `sayHello()` function with this:

<CodeFile filename="server/module.ts">

```typescript
import { micromark } from "micromark"
import { File } from "node:buffer"

export async function markdownToHtml(markdownFile: File | string) {
	const markdown = typeof markdownFile === "string" ? markdownFile : await markdownFile.text()
	const html = micromark(markdown)
	return new File([html], "snippet.html", { type: "text/html" })
}
markdownToHtml.rpc = true
```

</CodeFile>

<Aside>

If using Bun or Deno, you do not need to import `File` as it's already a global.

</Aside>

This function takes either a string of Markdown or a Markdown file and converts it into an HTML file. We can test this
out directly by just making a request to the server to retrieve the file itself:

<CodeFile>

```zsh
curl --request GET --url "http://localhost:3001/prim/markdownToHtml?0=Hello%20there"
```

</CodeFile>

We can call this function from the client like so:

<CodeFile filename="client/index.ts">

```typescript {3-5,8}
import { client } from "./prim"

const markdown = "[**Backend**, meet **Frontend**.](https://prim.doseofted.me/)"
const htmlFile = await client.markdownToHtml(markdown)
console.log(htmlFile.name, htmlFile instanceof File)

const app = document.getElementById("app")
if (app) app.innerHTML = await htmlFile.text()
```

</CodeFile>

If we open the page in the browser, we should now see our Markdown content as formatted content on the page.

## Extended Types

Prim+RPC can support all types in function arguments and return values that are supported in JSON, as well as Files and
Blobs (by skipping the JSON serialization step). However we may want to work with additional types like Dates, Maps, and
Sets, which are not supported by the default JSON handler. That's why Prim+RPC allows you to swap out this JSON handler
with you own.

For instance, you may use [superjson](https://github.com/blitz-js/superjson#readme) to support many JavaScript built-ins
or [devalue](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/devalue#readme) to support cyclical references. In fact, it doesn't even
need to be JSON. You may choose to serialize messages using [yaml](https://github.com/eemeli/yaml#readme) for
readability or [msgpack](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-javascript#readme) for its size and extended type support.

We'll set up superjson as an example. First, let's install the package in both server and client parts of the project.

<CodeFile>

```zsh
cd server && pnpm add superjson
cd ..
cd client && pnpm add superjson
```

</CodeFile>

Now we can set up the handler. On the server:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeFile filename="server/index.ts">

```typescript {6} /jsonHandler/2
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { primFetch } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/server-fetch"
import * as module from "./module"
import { createServer } from "node:http"
import { createServerAdapter } from "@whatwg-node/server"
import jsonHandler from "superjson"

const prim = createPrimServer({ module, jsonHandler })
function postprocess(res: Response) {
	res.headers.set("access-control-allow-origin", "http://localhost:3000")
	res.headers.set("access-control-allow-headers", "content-type")
}
const fetch = primFetch({ prim, postprocess })

const fetchAdapter = createServerAdapter(fetch)
createServer(fetchAdapter).listen(3001)
console.log("Prim+RPC is available at http://localhost:3001/prim")

export type Module = typeof module

```

</CodeFile>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

And on the client:

<CodeFile filename="client/prim.ts">

```typescript {4} /jsonHandler/2
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { createMethodPlugin } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/browser-fetch"
import type { Module } from "../server"
import jsonHandler from "superjson"

export default createPrimClient<Module>({
	endpoint: "http://localhost:3001/prim",
	methodPlugin: createMethodPlugin(),
	jsonHandler,
})
```

</CodeFile>

That's all there is to it! Let's try it out with a function that accepts a Date. Replace our `markdownToHtml()` function
from the last example with the function below:

<CodeFile filename="server/module.ts">

```typescript {6-9}
export function whatIsDayAfter(day: Date) {
	return new Date(day.valueOf() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
}
whatIsDayAfter.rpc = true
```

</CodeFile>

And now we can call that function from the client:

<CodeFile filename="client/index.ts">

```typescript {3-4,7}
import { client } from "./prim"

const tomorrow = await client.whatIsDayAfter(new Date())
console.log(tomorrow, tomorrow instanceof Date)

const app = document.getElementById("app")
if (app) app.innerText = tomorrow.toDateString()
```

</CodeFile>

We can check the developer's console or reload to the page to find that we have received a new Date. We can swap out
this JSON handler with another as needed. Check out the available plugins to learn how to set up other JSON handlers.

We already can do a lot with Prim+RPC but we we can do even more with callbacks.

## Support Callbacks

We can pass callbacks to our functions to receive events from the server as they happen, as opposed to polling the
server manually. In Prim+RPC, we can pass callbacks as long as a **callback handler** is set up.

Callbacks are handled differently from methods. While methods return only once, callbacks on a method may be called
multiple times, meaning we need to support multiple responses from the server. There are several ways to support this
but for this guide, we will set up a WebSocket server and use it with an available callback handler for Prim+RPC.

In Node, we can use [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws#readme) to add support for WebSockets. First install the
package.

<CodeFile>

```zsh
cd server
pnpm add ws
pnpm add -D @types/ws
```

</CodeFile>

Now we can configure the WebSocket server with our HTTP server, to handle upgrades to the connection. This setup may
look complicated, and WebSockets can be difficult, but with Prim+RPC we only have to worry about this once.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}


<CodeFile filename="server/index.ts">

```typescript {6,9,21-25}
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { primFetch } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/server-fetch"
import * as module from "./module"
import { createServer } from "node:http"
import { createServerAdapter } from "@whatwg-node/server"
import { WebSocketServer } from "ws"
import jsonHandler from "superjson"

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ noServer: true })
const prim = createPrimServer({ module, jsonHandler })
function postprocess(res: Response) {
	res.headers.set("access-control-allow-origin", "http://localhost:3000")
	res.headers.set("access-control-allow-headers", "content-type")
}
const fetch = primFetch({ prim, postprocess })

const fetchAdapter = createServerAdapter(fetch)
const server = createServer(fetchAdapter).listen(3001)
console.log("Prim+RPC is available at http://localhost:3001/prim")

server.on("upgrade", (request, socket, head) => {
	wss.handleUpgrade(request, socket, head, ws => {
		wss.emit("connection", ws, request)
	})
})

export type Module = typeof module

```

</CodeFile>

Let's take a deep breath. Our WebSockets are now configured! Now let's create a callback handler that will use this
WebSocket connection. This step is much less complicated.

<CodeFile filename="server/index.ts">

```typescript {3,11} /callbackHandler/2
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { primFetch } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/server-fetch"
import { createCallbackHandler } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/ws"
import * as module from "./module"
import { createServer } from "node:http"
import { createServerAdapter } from "@whatwg-node/server"
import { WebSocketServer } from "ws"
import jsonHandler from "superjson"

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ noServer: true })
const callbackHandler = createCallbackHandler({ wss })
const prim = createPrimServer({ module, jsonHandler, callbackHandler })
function postprocess(res: Response) {
	res.headers.set("access-control-allow-origin", "http://localhost:3000")
	res.headers.set("access-control-allow-headers", "content-type")
}
const fetch = primFetch({ prim, postprocess })

const fetchAdapter = createServerAdapter(fetch)
const server = createServer(fetchAdapter).listen(3001)
console.log("Prim+RPC is available at http://localhost:3001/prim")

server.on("upgrade", (request, socket, head) => {
	wss.handleUpgrade(request, socket, head, ws => {
		wss.emit("connection", ws, request)
	})
})

export type Module = typeof module

```

</CodeFile>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

We're almost ready to use callbacks. But since we created a callback handler on the server, we will need a compatible
callback plugin on the client. Since we're using WebSockets on the server, we'll use the WebSocket callback plugin on
the client:

<CodeFile filename="client/prim.ts">

```typescript {3,10}
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { createMethodPlugin } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/browser-fetch"
import { createCallbackPlugin } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/browser-websocket"
import type { Module } from "../server"
import jsonHandler from "superjson"

export default createPrimClient<Module>({
	endpoint: "http://localhost:3001/prim",
	methodPlugin: createMethodPlugin(),
	callbackPlugin: createCallbackPlugin(),
	jsonHandler,
})
```

</CodeFile>

<Aside>
	Since our callback handler is using the same server, we can use the same endpoint. Prim+RPC will replace the protocol
	on our endpoint for us. Prim+RPC also provides a `wsEndpoint` option if the callback handler ever uses a separate
	address.
</Aside>

Now we're ready to use callbacks on our methods. Let's define one now. Replace the `whatIsDayAfter()` function, or
`sayHello()` function if the [Extended Types](#extended-types) section was skipped, with the following:

<CodeFile filename="server/module.ts">

```typescript
export function typeMessage(message: string, typed: (letter: string) => void) {
	let timeout = 0
	const letters = message.split("")
	for (const letter of letters) {
		setTimeout(() => typed(letter), ++timeout * 300)
	}
}
typeMessage.rpc = true
```

</CodeFile>

Now we can use this callback on the client. Let's update our client to use this new function:

<CodeFile filename="client/index.ts">

```typescript {5-7}
import { client } from "./prim"

const app = document.getElementById("app")
if (app) {
	client.typeMessage("Hello!", letter => {
		app.innerText += letter
	})
}
```

</CodeFile>

Typing a message isn't exactly a great use of server resources but it is a good demo. We can now open the console to see
each letter of our message logged and see that message typed on our webpage.

## Pass Server Context

Prim+RPC separates the method of communication between server and client from your function logic, allowing you to write
framework-agnostic code. But there are times where you need data only available in your server's context.

<Aside>

If you are running the starter project in a hosted environment like Stackblitz, you will need to adjust CORS rules to
match the domain where your project is hosted.

</Aside>

We can share this server context with Prim+RPC. Better yet, we can transform the server context so that our functions
only receive data relevant to them.

In this example, we'll set a secret cookie from the client that is required to access our secret function. Without the
cookie: no function access. However our function won't have to touch the cookie at all.

<Aside type="warning">
	**This is only a demo.** In a real application, you will want to use some form of cryptography.
</Aside>

First, let's install a small helper package to manage cookies on the server. This isn't specific to Prim+RPC but will be
used by our HTTP server.

<CodeFile>

```zsh
cd server
pnpm add cookie
pnpm add -D @types/cookie
```

</CodeFile>

Now we can use this package with our server. Our `primFetch` method handler (and all method handlers in Prim+RPC) accept
a `contextTransform` option that takes the server context as an argument, in this case our Request object, and returns a
variable that will be bound to our function's `this` context.

Let's set this up now.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<CodeFile filename="server/index.ts">

```typescript {9,11-23} /contextTransform/3
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { primFetch } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/server-fetch"
import { createCallbackHandler } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/ws"
import * as module from "./module"
import { createServer } from "node:http"
import { createServerAdapter } from "@whatwg-node/server"
import { WebSocketServer } from "ws"
import jsonHandler from "superjson"
import { parse, serialize } from "cookie"

const cookieOpts = { httpOnly: true, sameSite: "none", secure: true } as const
function contextTransform(req: Request, res: { headers: Headers }) {
	const secret = "can't-touch-this"
	return {
		setSecret(given: string) {
			res.headers.set("set-cookie", serialize("secret", given, cookieOpts))
		},
		get allowed() {
			return secret === parse(req.headers.get("cookie") ?? "").secret
		},
	}
}
export type ServerContext = ReturnType<typeof contextTransform>

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ noServer: true })
const callbackHandler = createCallbackHandler({ wss })
const prim = createPrimServer({ module, jsonHandler, callbackHandler })
function postprocess(res: Response) {
	res.headers.set("access-control-allow-origin", "http://localhost:3000")
	res.headers.set("access-control-allow-headers", "content-type")
}
const fetch = primFetch({ prim, postprocess, contextTransform })

const fetchAdapter = createServerAdapter(fetch)
const server = createServer(fetchAdapter).listen(3001)
console.log("Prim+RPC is available at http://localhost:3001/prim")

server.on("upgrade", (request, socket, head) => {
	wss.handleUpgrade(request, socket, head, ws => {
		wss.emit("connection", ws, request)
	})
})

export type Module = typeof module

```

</CodeFile>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

We have defined a function and a property that we want to expose to our functions: `setSecret()` will set the secret and
`allowed` will return whether the secret is set to the correct value.

Note that we have defined a `ServerContext` interface. This will become available to our functions. We can now utilize
the new interface in our functions, like so:

<CodeFile filename="server/module.ts">

```typescript
import type { ServerContext } from "./index"

export function secretMessage(this: ServerContext, secret?: string) {
	if (secret) {
		this.setSecret(secret)
		return ""
	}
	if (!this.allowed) throw new Error("No secret, no entry.")
	return "Access granted! The answer is 42."
}
secretMessage.rpc = true
```

</CodeFile>

Our function can now return a message to the client, only if the correct cookie is given. Yet it doesn't touch the
actual cookie. Also note that passing `this` as an argument is only necessary if you are using TypeScript. It is removed
from generated code and
[only serves as a type hint](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-0.html#specifying-the-type-of-this-for-functions).

<Aside>
	Passing server context in this way can be useful for swapping out implementations of a server. If we ever swap our the
	server in the future, our function logic doesn't change. We simply modify the `contextTransform` function to match our
	new server.
</Aside>

There is one last step to perform on our Prim+RPC client. Since we are setting a cookie from the server, we must set the
`credentials` [option of the fetch function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch#include) to
"include" so that cookies can be set properly. we can do this easily with our method plugin:

<CodeFile filename="client/prim.ts">

```typescript /{ credentials: "include" }/
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { createMethodPlugin } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/browser-fetch"
import { createCallbackPlugin } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/browser-websocket"
import type { Module } from "../server"
import jsonHandler from "superjson"

export default createPrimClient<Module>({
	endpoint: "http://localhost:3001/prim",
	methodPlugin: createMethodPlugin({ credentials: "include" }),
	callbackPlugin: createCallbackPlugin(),
	jsonHandler,
})
```

</CodeFile>

Now let's call this function from the client:

<CodeFile filename="client/index.ts">

```typescript {3,6-10}
import { client } from "./prim"

await client.secretMessage("can't-touch-this")

const app = document.getElementById("app")
if (app) app.innerText = await client.secretMessage()
```

</CodeFile>

Because we passed the correct secret, we can see the secret message from the server. And because this secret has been
set in the cookie, we don't need to set it again. For demonstration, comment out that first line:

<CodeFile filename="client/index.ts">

```typescript {3}
import { client } from "./prim"

// await client.secretMessage("can't-touch-this")

const app = document.getElementById("app")
if (app) app.innerText = await client.secretMessage()
```

</CodeFile>

And note that we can still access the secret message because we've already set the secret in a cookie! So we don't need
to pass it in our function unless that cookie is removed.

This can be a powerful tool for setting up authentication, adding redirects, or otherwise integrating with the server of
your choice.
