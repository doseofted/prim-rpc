## What is It?

The goal of Prim+RPC is to make communication between server and client effortless: create a function on the server and
call that function directly on the client, without any special framework considerations, as if that function exists on
the same device. It is the RPC framework for JavaScript designed to be invisible, so that you can write the code that
you want to write.

Prim+RPC is the bridge between two separated JavaScript environments: web server and client, two browser tabs, web
workers, or two totally separate processes. Prim+RPC handles the hard parts for you. Arguments you pass on the client
are processed automatically so that the server receives them in the same format that you sent them. It can even support
callbacks, files and blobs, and other advanced types like Maps/Sets. Return values and any thrown errors are also
processed in the same way.

Finally, Prim+RPC is designed to work with the tooling that you already use, without relying on complicated build steps
or client generation. The core of the framework is very lightweight, with a heavy focus on RPC, and relies on plugins to
communicate between your chosen server and client. You may write a plugin to work with your favorite frameworks or use
one of the many plugins that are already available.

## An Example

Let's demonstrate with a simple example. Let's say that we have defined a function on the server that we want to share
with the client.

<CodeFile filename="server/greetings.ts">

```typescript
/** Our first function */
export function hello(name = "world") {
	return `Hello ${name}!`
}
```

</CodeFile>
