## What is It?

The goal of Prim+RPC is to make communication between server and client effortless: create a function on the server and
call that function directly on the client, without any special framework considerations, as if that function exists on
the same device. It is the RPC framework for JavaScript designed to be invisible, so that you can write the code that
you want to write.

Prim+RPC is the bridge between two separated JavaScript environments: web server and client, two browser tabs, web
workers, or two totally separate processes. Prim+RPC handles the hard parts for you. Arguments passed on the client are
processed automatically so that the server receives them in the same format that you sent them. It can even support
callbacks, files and blobs, and other advanced types like Maps/Sets. Return values and any thrown errors are also
processed in the same way.

Finally, Prim+RPC is designed to work with the tooling that you already use, without relying on complicated build steps
or client generation. The core of the framework is very lightweight, with a tight focus on RPC, and relies on plugins to
communicate between your chosen server and client. You may write a plugin for your favorite frameworks or use one of the
many plugins that are already available.

## An Example

Let's demonstrate with a simple example, all contained in a single file. Let's say that we have defined a function on
the server that we want to share with the client.

<CodeFile filename="index.ts">

```typescript
function sayHello(x = "Backend", y = "Frontend") {
	return `${x}, meet ${y}.`
}
```

</CodeFile>

Usually, we would set up a server, create a route for the function and call that route from the client. That works but
we're no longer working with our original function: we're creating and removing wrappers around it. And these wrappers
become more difficult to process when we have a long list of functions with more complicated arguments and return types.

If the server is JavaScript and the client is JavaScript, shouldn't we be able to call the function, like it's
JavaScript? Let's set up Prim+RPC to make that possible.

First, let's mark our function as RPC. Functions in JavaScript are also Objects so we'll add an `.rpc` property to it,
signaling that we intend to make this into RPC.

<CodeFile filename="index.ts">

```typescript {4}
function sayHello(x = "Backend", y = "Frontend") {
	return `${x}, meet ${y}.`
}
sayHello.rpc = true
```

</CodeFile>

Now we can set up the server. For testing, we'll using the testing plugins that come with Prim+RPC.

<CodeFile filename="index.ts">

```typescript {1-2,9-11}
import { createPrimServer, testing } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
const plugins = testing.createPrimTestingPlugins()

function sayHello(x = "Backend", y = "Frontend") {
	return `${x}, meet ${y}.`
}
sayHello.rpc = true

const module = { sayHello }
const { methodHandler, callbackHandler } = plugins
const server = createPrimServer({ module, methodHandler, callbackHandler })
```

</CodeFile>

We passed our function directly to the server. The server-side "handlers" will process RPC given from the client. Our
function can now be called from the client! Let's set that up next.

<CodeFile filename="index.ts">

```typescript {13-14}
import { createPrimServer, testing } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
const plugins = testing.createPrimTestingPlugins()

function sayHello(x = "Backend", y = "Frontend") {
	return `${x}, meet ${y}.`
}
sayHello.rpc = true

const module = { sayHello }
const { methodHandler, callbackHandler } = plugins
const server = createPrimServer({ module, methodHandler, callbackHandler })

const { methodPlugin, callbackPlugin } = plugins
const client = createPrimClient<typeof module>({ methodPlugin, callbackPlugin })
```

</CodeFile>

The client-side plugins will turn our function call into RPC for the server. Now we can call our function!

<CodeFile filename="index.ts">

```typescript {16-18}
import { createPrimServer, testing } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
const plugins = testing.createPrimTestingPlugins()

function sayHello(x = "Backend", y = "Frontend") {
	return `${x}, meet ${y}.`
}
sayHello.rpc = true

const module = { sayHello }
const { methodHandler, callbackHandler } = plugins
const server = createPrimServer({ module, methodHandler, callbackHandler })

const { methodPlugin, callbackPlugin } = plugins
const client = createPrimClient<typeof module>({ methodPlugin, callbackPlugin })

const greeting = await client.sayHello("Backend", "Frontend")
const expected = sayHello("Backend", "Frontend")
console.log(greeting, greeting === expected)
```

</CodeFile>

And that's it! You'll find that `greeting` is equal to `expected`. But notice that the client was never given direct
access to the `sayHello()` function, only the type definitions. Instead, that call was transformed into and from RPC.

This is Prim+RPC's single magic trick: call the function on the client without having the function readily available.
