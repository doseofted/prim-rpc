This guide builds on the [basic setup guide](/docs/v0/learn/setup) and will use the same starter project.

## Extended Types

Prim+RPC can support all types in function arguments and return values that are supported in JSON. It even supports
Files and Blobs (by skipping the JSON serialization step). However we may want to work with additional types like Dates,
Maps, and Sets, which are not supported by the default JSON handler. That's why Prim+RPC allows you to swap out this
JSON handler with you own.

For instance, you may use [superjson](https://github.com/blitz-js/superjson#readme) to support many JavaScript built-ins
or [devalue](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/devalue#readme) to support cyclical references. In fact, it doesn't even
need to be JSON. You may choose to serialize messages using [yaml](https://github.com/eemeli/yaml#readme) for
readability or [msgpack](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-javascript#readme) for its size and extended type support.

We'll set up superjson as an example. First, let's install the package in both server and client parts of the project.

<CodeFile>

```zsh
cd server && pnpm add superjson
cd ..
cd client && pnpm add superjson
```

</CodeFile>

Now we can set up the handler. On the server:

<CodeFile filename="server/index.ts">

```typescript {6} /jsonHandler/2
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { primFetch } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/server-fetch"
import * as module from "./module"
import { createServer } from "node:http"
import { createServerAdapter } from "@whatwg-node/server"
import jsonHandler from "superjson"

const prim = createPrimServer({ module, jsonHandler })
function postprocess(res: Response) {
	res.headers.set("access-control-allow-origin", "http://localhost:5173")
	res.headers.set("access-control-allow-headers", "content-type")
}
const fetch = primFetch({ prim, postprocess })

const fetchAdapter = createServerAdapter(fetch)
createServer(fetchAdapter).listen(3000)
console.log("Prim+RPC is available at http://localhost:3000/prim")

export type Module = typeof module
```

</CodeFile>

And on the client:

<CodeFile filename="client/prim.ts">

```typescript {4} /jsonHandler/2
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { createMethodPlugin } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/browser-fetch"
import type { Module } from "../server"
import jsonHandler from "superjson"

export default createPrimClient<Module>({
	endpoint: "http://localhost:3000/prim",
	methodPlugin: createMethodPlugin(),
	jsonHandler,
})
```

</CodeFile>

That's all there is to it! Let's try it out with a function that accepts a Date. Replace our `sayHello()` function with
the function below:

<CodeFile filename="server/module.ts">

```typescript {6-9}
export function whatIsDayAfter(day: Date) {
	return new Date(day.valueOf() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
}
whatIsDayAfter.rpc = true
```

</CodeFile>

And now we can call that function from the client:

<CodeFile filename="client/index.ts">

```typescript {3-4} /tomorrow.toDateString()/
import { client } from "./prim"

const tomorrow = await client.whatIsDayAfter(new Date())
console.log(tomorrow, tomorrow instanceof Date)

const app = document.getElementById("app")
if (app) app.innerText = tomorrow.toDateString()
```

</CodeFile>

We can check the developer's console or reload to the page to find that we have received a new Date. We can swap out
this JSON handler with another as needed. Check out the available plugins to learn how to set up other JSON handlers.

We already can do a lot with Prim+RPC but we we can do even more with callbacks.
