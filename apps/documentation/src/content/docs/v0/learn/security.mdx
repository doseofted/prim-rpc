Prim+RPC is a low-level library and keeps a narrow scope: handling RPC and providing the tools to easily integrate with
other libraries. There are a few things to keep in mind when using Prim+RPC to keep your functions secure.

## Selectively Import

Prim+RPC is very selective about what gets exposed from the server. Functions (and functions only) must be passed to the
server, must explicitly be marked as RPC, must not be defined on another function, and cannot access built-in functions.

While this provides a lot of protection against accidental imports, you should still be cautious about what is passed to
the Prim+PRC server. If Prim+RPC doesn't need access to a function or variable then don't pass it to the server.

## Validate Arguments

Prim+PRC validates that messages passed to it is RPC but it does not validate what's in that RPC. This means that
arguments passed to your function and their return values are not validated for you: this is the developer's
responsibility. Validation is especially important if your RPC is sent over a network like an HTTP server.

This also makes Prim+RPC very flexible. You may use any validation library of your choice because validation is part of
your function logic and not restricted by your server framework.

## Secure the Transport

Prim+RPC does not transport your RPC messages. It creates RPC messages and passes them to your server and client
frameworks. Securing the transport means something different for every environment and falls outside of Prim+RPC's
scope. When sending RPC over a network for instance, you will want to use a security certificate and implement relevant
security headers. These may be provided by or be options of your server framework.

## Safely Serialize

Prim+RPC uses the default JSON "stringify" method to serialize RPC and the [destr](https://github.com/unjs/destr#readme)
library to deserialize RPC by default. You may override this behavior by providing your own alternative JSON handler.
However you should be aware of any possible security implications of doing so.

Particularly, consider whether the library has protection for prototype pollution or has any unpatched security
vulnerabilities. If your custom JSON handler allows additional types or supports circular references, consider how this
may impact your code.
