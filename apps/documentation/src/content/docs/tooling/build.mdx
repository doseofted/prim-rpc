This tool is in early stages and the interface is expected to change significantly.

The "Prevent Build" utility is a simple way of preventing a build using popular bundlers if server-specific code is
accidentally imported. This is not required and often times is not needed as server and client are typically located in
separate parts of a project but it can provide additional peace of mind that a developer doesn't import server code in
the client.

The utility is built with [unplugin](https://github.com/unjs/unplugin#readme) which means it can support the most
popular bundlers used with JavaScript. Below is an example of how it may be used in Vite:

<CodeFile>

```typescript
import path from "node:path"
import { defineConfig } from "vite"
import preventImport, { BuildModifyMethod } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-tooling/build"

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [
		preventImport.vite({
			name: path.join(__dirname, "server"),
			method: BuildModifyMethod.BuildTimeEmptyExport,
		}),
	],
})
```

</CodeFile>

You may also use this plugin with Webpack or Rollup, among others.

This example blocks imports from the `./server{:txt}` directory by replacing the contents of the imported file with an
empty export. There are several methods to block imports:

- `BuildModifyMethod.BuildTimeEmptyExport` happens at **build-time** and replaces imported server code with an empty
  export
- `BuildModifyMethod.RunTimeProcessCheck` happens at **run-time** and prepends a statement that throws an error if
  server code is imported by checking `process.server`. This is useful for flagging such errors in testing frameworks.
- `BuildModifyMethod.RunTimeWindowCheck` also happens at **run-time** and is similar to the last option except instead
  of checking `process.server` it checks if the `typeof window === "undefined"`.
