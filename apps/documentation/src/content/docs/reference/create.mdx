Prim+RPC does not include methods to transport RPC by default. Instead, it relies on plugins so that the core of the
library is framework-agnostic. It could be used with HTTP servers, WebSocket servers, between Web Workers, separate
processes, or other transports.

<Aside type="warning">

This is an advanced guide and is not required for most usages of Prim+RPC.

</Aside>

Prim+RPC communicates between the server and client over two types of plugins, each with a version for the server and
client. **Method plugins** handle calls to methods. **Callback plugins** optionally handle callbacks on those methods.
Plugins used on the server are referred to as **handlers** to easily differentiate server/client.

In this guide we will learn how to create our own plugins for Prim+RPC. Note that there are
[many plugins already available to use](/docs/reference/plugins) and you may not need to create your own. This may be
considered an advanced topic for most users and is not required for most usages of Prim+RPC.

## Method Plugin

A Method Plugin is given RPC as an object and returns back a promise containing an RPC result object given from a
[Method Handler](#method-handler). Every method plugin may be started from the following skeleton:

<CodeFile>

```typescript
import { type PrimClientMethodPlugin, createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"

interface Options {
	/* (options for your plugin) */
}
export function createMethodPlugin(options?: Options): PrimClientMethodPlugin {
	return async function (endpoint, rpcBody, jsonHandler, blobs) {
		/* (plugin code here) */
	}
}

/* (this method plugin can be passed to Prim+RPC) */
const methodPlugin = createMethodPlugin()
const client = createPrimClient({ methodPlugin })
```

</CodeFile>

The `createMethodPlugin` function is configured with your options and returns a function compatible with Prim+RPC's
method plugin option. In this function, your plugin is given the following arguments:

- `endpoint` is the [URL given to Prim+RPC](/docs/reference/config#-endpoint). This is useful if your plugin
  communicates over a URL, otherwise it may be ignored.
- `rpcBody` is the RPC to be sent, as an object. If batching is enabled, this will be an array of RPC calls. It should
  be processed by the given JSON Handler.
- `jsonHandler` is the [JSON Handler configured with Prim+RPC](/docs/reference/config#-json-handler). This option should
  be used instead of the environment's default JSON object.
- `blobs` is a key/value record of binary blobs. This is only used if
  [Prim+RPC is configured to handle Blobs](/docs/reference/config#-handle-blobs). The key is a string identifier used in
  the RPC (in `rpcBody`) and the value is a File or Blob.

The return value of this function should be the RPC result as an object. Your transport (method handler) may returned a
serialized version of this RPC. It should be deserialized using the provided `jsonHandler` argument.

You may [reference existing plugin code](https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc/tree/main/libs/plugins) to learn how they
typically transport RPC over protocols like HTTP, WebSocket, or others.

## Method Handler

A Method Handler is given RPC from the transport of your choice, provided by a [Method Plugin](#method-plugin), and
sends this data back to your transport, to be handled again by the Method Plugin. The Prim+RPC "server" is a misnomer
and doesn't actually serve RPC, instead this function is a wrapper around setup performed by the server of your choice.

  Method Handler->>Server: Generic response with RPC result(s)
  Server->>Method Plugin: Response with RPC result(s)
  Method Plugin->>Prim RPC Client: RPC result(s)</pre>
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Server Handlers are used with Prim+RPC in one of two ways, depending on how the transport is configured. You may either
pass a Method Handler function to Prim+RPC or you may pass a Prim+RPC instance to your Method Handler. The latter is
only used when your server exports functions which are called by your server (this is the case in many serverless
environments).

Below is a basic skeleton of a method handler:

<CodeFile>

```typescript
import { type PrimServerMethodHandler, createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"

interface Options {
	/* (options for your handler plugin) */
}
export function createMethodHandler(options: Options): PrimServerMethodHandler {
	return prim => {
		/* (handler registration here) */
		const {} = prim.server()
	}
}

const methodHandler = createMethodHandler()
const prim = createPrimServer({ methodHandler })
```

</CodeFile>

The `createMethodHandler` function is configured with your options and returns a function compatible with
[Prim+RPC's Method Handler option](/docs/reference/config#-method-handler). In this function, your handler is given a
single argument `prim` which contains the following:

- `prim.options`: Options as given to the Prim+RPC instance
- `prim.server()`: a function that creates a new Prim+RPC server instance

**Your method handler is only called once on Prim+RPC server initialization.** Inside of this function, you should set
up the server of your choice to respond to requests that come in. For instance if setting up an HTTP server, this would
be a configured route handler (and your HTTP server would then become an option of your setup function).

For each request that comes into your server, call the `prim.server()` function. **This function should be called for
every request that comes into your server framework.** That may look something like this (this example assumes
[some connect-based server](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect#readme) is used):

<CodeFile>

```typescript {5,8,11-13}
import { type PrimServerMethodHandler, createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"

interface Options {
	/* (options for your handler plugin) */
	app: any
}
export function createMethodHandler(options: Options): PrimServerMethodHandler {
	const { app } = options
	return prim => {
		/* (example handler registration here) */
		app.use((req, res, next) => {
			const { prepareCall, prepareRpc, prepareSend, call } = prim.server()
		})
	}
}

const methodHandler = createMethodHandler()
const prim = createPrimServer({ methodHandler })
```

</CodeFile>

The result of this function call to `prim.server()` contains several methods to transform requests into RPC that
Prim+RPC can understand.

- `server.prepareCall()` takes common server options and transforms it into an RPC object.
- `server.prepareRpc()` takes result of `server.prepareCall()` and creates an RPC result object from the function call.
- `server.prepareSend()` takes the result of `server.prepareRpc()` and serializes it into common server response
  options.
- `server.call()` is a shortcut that calls all of the above methods in order. This is useful in HTTP/WebSocket server
  environments but no so much in others (such as IPC).

When setting up a method handler to be used with Prim+RPC, you may use all of these options. If your method handler does
not use HTTP, you may only need to use `server.prepareRpc()`. If only `server.prepareRpc()` you may need to serialize
RPC using the JSON Handler given in `prim.options`.

The result of calling these functions should be passed back to your configured server framework to send back a response.
You may learn how to implement your own by
[referencing existing plugin code](https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc/tree/main/libs/plugins).

## Callback Plugin

A Callback Plugin is given options from the Prim+RPC client and returns back functions to be called whenever a new
function call is made from the client. Your chosen transport will receive new messages (from the
[Callback Handler](#callback-handler)) and convert this into an RPC result that is then shared with the Prim+RPC client.

The skeleton of a Callback Plugin may look like this:

<CodeFile>

```typescript
import { type PrimClientCallbackPlugin, createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"

interface Options {
	/* (options for your plugin) */
}
export function createCallbackPlugin(options: Options): PrimClientCallbackPlugin {
	return (endpoint, events, jsonHandler) => {
		/* (plugin implementation here) */
		return {
			send(rpcBody) {},
			close() {},
		}
	}
}

/* (this callback plugin can be passed to Prim+RPC) */
const callbackPlugin = createCallbackPlugin()
const client = createPrimClient({ callbackPlugin })
```

</CodeFile>

The `createCallbackPlugin` function is configured with your options and returns a function compatible with Prim+RPC's
[Callback Plugin option](/docs/reference/config#-callback-plugin). In this function, your plugin is given the following
arguments:

- `endpoint` is the [URL given to Prim+RPC](/docs/reference/config#-websocket-endpoint). This is useful if your plugin
  communicates over a URL, otherwise it may be ignored.
- `events` is an object that contains three functions: `events.connected()` when the transport connects,
  `events.response()` when a new message is received, and `events.ended()` when the transport disconnects.
- `jsonHandler` is the [JSON Handler configured with Prim+RPC](/docs/reference/config#-json-handler). This option should
  be used instead of the environment's default JSON object inside of your defined `send()` method and the
  `events.response()` function.

The Callback Plugin is only called once for each new connection over your transport. The existing plugin will continue
to be used until you call `events.ended()` which will signal that this plugin can no longer be used without
re-initializing. Somewhere in your transport you should listen for new messages from the server and send these back
using `events.response()` with the RPC result as an argument. You may serialize that argument using the provided JSON
Handler.

With an active connection, the functions you return from your Callback Plugin will be called on all subsequent events.
The `send()` method will send a new message over your transport and the `close()` method will terminate an active
connection.

You may [reference existing plugin code](https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc/tree/main/libs/plugins) to learn how they
typically transport RPC over protocols like HTTP, WebSocket, or others.

## Callback Handler

A Callback Handler is given new messages from the transport of your choice, provided by a
[Callback Plugin](#callback-plugin), and sends this data back to your transport. In addition, it maintains that
connection to send additional messages for the same request over your transport. This is useful for callbacks which may
fire multiple times.

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

The diagram is somewhat intimidating but the implementation is less complicated, as steps like making the connection and
sending callback results is largely handled by other frameworks rather than your plugin: you just need to support the
given events.

Below is a skeleton of what a callback handler may look like:

<CodeFile>

```typescript
import { type PrimServerCallbackHandler, createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"

interface Options {
	/* (options for your handler plugin) */
}
export function createCallbackHandler(options: Options): PrimServerCallbackHandler {
	return prim => {
		/* (handler registration here) */
	}
}

const callbackHandler = createCallbackHandler()
const prim = createPrimServer({ callbackHandler })
```

</CodeFile>

The `createCallbackHandler` function is configured with your options and returns a function compatible with
[Prim+RPC's Callback Handler option](/docs/reference/config#-callback-handler). In this function, your handler is given
a single argument `prim` which contains the following:

- `prim.options`: Options as given to the Prim+RPC instance
- `prim.connected()`: a function that creates a new active Prim+RPC server instance.

Unlike the method handler's `prim.server()` option, the `prim.connected()` event is intended to keep an active
connection to the client as opposed to sending a single response and then closing the connection.
