import CodeFile from "@/components/Code/CodeFile.astro"

Prim+RPC supports Hono and is very easy to set up. First, let's set up our functions to be used on the server:

<CodeFile filename="functions.ts">

```typescript
export function hello() {
	return "Hi from Prim+RPC!"
}
hello.rpc = true

export default hello
```

</CodeFile>

We can expose these functions to the client by setting up Hono and Prim+RPC:

<CodeFile filename="index.ts">

```typescript
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { createMethodHandler } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/hono"
import { Hono } from "hono"
import * as module from "./functions"

const app = new Hono()

const methodHandler = createMethodHandler({ app })
createPrimServer({ module, methodHandler })

export default app
```

</CodeFile>

This example shows how Hono may be used from a serverless environment but you may reference Hono's documentation to
learn how to set it up in frameworks like Node and others.

We can test that this example is working by making a call over the command line (note that your server address will need
to be changed):

<CodeFile>

```zsh
curl --request GET --url "http://localhost:3000/prim"
```

</CodeFile>
