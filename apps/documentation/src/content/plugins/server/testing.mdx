import CodeFile from "@/components/Code/CodeFile.astro"

Prim+RPC includes testing utilities to test itself over a generic event handler within the same file but while
undergoing all of the typical events and transformations involved in sending RPC between two separated environments.
This is useful for testing environments to ensure that functions can be used as RPC without the need to polyfill or set
up real servers.

First, we'll set up some module that we want to use with Prim+RPC:

<CodeFile filename="index.ts">

```typescript
export function hello() {
	return "Hi from Prim+RPC!"
}
hello.rpc = true

export default hello
```

</CodeFile>

And now we can set up our tests (we'll use Vitest as an example):

<CodeFile filename="index.test.ts">

```typescript
import { createPrimServer, createPrimClient, testing } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import * as module from "./index"
import { test, expect } from "vitest"

const plugins = testing.createPrimTestingPlugins()

const { methodHandler, callbackHandler } = plugins
const server = createPrimServer({ module, methodHandler, callbackHandler })

const { methodPlugin, callbackPlugin } = plugins
const client = createPrimClient<typeof module>({ methodPlugin, callbackPlugin })

test("RPC result equals local result", () => {
	const greeting = client.hello()
	const expected = module.hello()
	expect(greeting).resolves.toEqual(expected)
})
```

</CodeFile>

That's all there is to it!
