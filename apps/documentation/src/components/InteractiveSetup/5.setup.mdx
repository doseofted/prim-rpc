import CodeFile from "@/components/Code/CodeFile.astro"
import PluginNA from "@/components/InteractiveSetup/PluginNA.astro"

Prim+RPC is now set up and ready to use! Try making a function call:

<CodeFile filename="client/index.ts">

```typescript
import { client } from "./prim"

const greeting = await client.sayHello()
console.log(greeting) // "Frontend, meet Backend."
```

</CodeFile>

Now we easily add more functions and simply call those function from the client.

<PluginNA message="You're all set up! Read on to support advanced types in your functions." type="success" />
