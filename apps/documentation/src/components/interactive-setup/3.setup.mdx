Our server is now fully configured and ready to work with the client! Let's set up the client next.

## Client Setup

Now that the server can receive function calls, we'll need a client that knows how to interact with the server. Let's
set that up now.

We'll start off with the following:

<CodeFile filename="client/index.ts">

```typescript
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import type { Module } from "../server"

const prim = createPrimClient<Module>()
```

</CodeFile>

We have set up the client and passed the type parameter from the server to get type definitions. Like the server, the
client doesn't do anything by itself. It needs compatible plugins to work with the server. Let's set that up now.
