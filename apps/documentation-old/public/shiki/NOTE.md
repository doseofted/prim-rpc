Some of the files in this folder can be hard to find. I've made note of these below:

- [TypeScript TextMate Grammar JSON](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-typescript-next/blob/main/syntaxes/TypeScript.tmLanguage.json)
  used under the MIT license. I believe this JSON was built from
  [TypeScript-TmLanguage](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage) (also MIT).
- [Bearded Theme (Monokai Stone)](https://github.com/BeardedBear/bearded-theme/blob/master/themes/bearded-theme-monokai-stone.json)
  used under MIT.
- [VS Code Oniguruma](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-oniguruma/blob/main/out/onig.wasm) used under MIT.
- [Shell-Unix-Bash Grammar JSON](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-textmate/blob/main/test-cases/themes/syntaxes/Shell-Unix-Bash.tmLanguage.json)
  used under the MIT license. This appears to have been created from
  [Shellscript TextMate Bundle](https://github.com/textmate/shellscript.tmbundle) which is used under the following
  license (appears to be common across many TextMate grammars):
  - ```txt
    Permission to copy, use, modify, sell and distribute this
    software is granted. This software is provided "as is" without
    express or implied warranty, and with no claim as to its
    suitability for any purpose.
    ```
