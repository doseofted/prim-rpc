# Contributions

Prim+RPC is intended to become **a standard way to communicate between JavaScript environments**. This means Prim+RPC
should be:

- Easy to use for developers of all skill levels
- Simple to integrate into your favorite server/client frameworks
- Flexible enough that other frameworks can build on top of it
- Stable, reliable, and very well documented

It can be difficult to achieve all of these goals and your contributions can help make this possible.
