# {meta.title}

Prim+RPC includes two functions for configuring Prim+RPC: one for the client (`createPrimClient()`) and another for the
server (`createPrimServer()`). Both of these functions accept options and are given in this reference guide.

This guide is split up into two sections: client options and server options. The Prim+RPC client expects client options
only while the Prim+RPC server accepts both client and server options.

The Prim+RPC server shares options with the client for two reasons. The first: some options should be shared with both
the server and client. For instance, if the JSON handler is changed on the client then it should also be changed on the
server for proper serialization. The second: if a function doesn't exist on module provided to Prim+RPC server then the
Prim+RPC server will create a new Prim+RPC client to contact another server (this is totally optional and allows
communication between multiple servers with dedicated responsibilities).

<Alert icon="carbon:information" type="alert-info" prose>

Some options must be set to the same value on both the server and the client. To make clear which properties must be
synced between client/server, you'll find **Sync Required** for each option below that will be either: **🟢 No** meaning
that the option can differ, or **🔴 Yes** meaning that option must be the same.

## Client

The following options are available to the `createPrimClient`:

```typescript
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { createMethodPlugin, createCallbackPlugin } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/{CHOOSE_YOUR_PLUGIN}"

// Tap option name below to see documentation
// You do not need to provide all of these options. This is just a demonstration.

const client = createPrimClient({
	// link[2:13] #methodplugin

### `.methodPlugin`

| Required  | Default                               | Sync Required |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| _`false`_ | _`(): { error: string, id: string }`_ | 🟢 No         |

Prim+RPC is designed to be flexible and work with the frameworks that you're already using. By default, Prim+RPC can
generate RPCs based on your method calls but does not include a way to send that RPC. This is handled through the usage
of plugins.

Specifically, the "method" plugin is used to generate a request and parse the response given from the Prim+RPC server.
For example, the "Browser API" plugin includes a method plugin that uses the web browser's Fetch API to send and receive
RPC.

You can either use a pre-built plugin (included with Prim+RPC) or
[you can build your own](/docs/plugins/create#method-plugin). Below is an example of how to register an existing method
plugin with the Prim+RPC client.

```typescript
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { createMethodPlugin } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/browser-fetch"

const methodPlugin = createMethodPlugin()
createPrimClient({ methodPlugin })
```

Each method plugin may (or may not) include its own options specific to that plugin. You can find a list of available
method plugins on this documentation website or you can
[follow this guide to create your own](/docs/plugins/create#method-plugin).

Once your method plugin is registered with the Prim+RPC client then you will also need to specify a compatible
[method "handler"](#methodhandler) on the Prim+RPC server. In general, a "plugin" in Prim+RPC is used to send/receive
RPC on a client while a "handler" (sometimes called a "handler plugin") is used by the Prim+RPC server to handle RPC and
send the RPC result back to the client.

One limitation of the "method" plugin is that it is intended to work with a single request (consisting of one or
multiple RPCs) and a single response (also consisting of one/multiple RPCs). This means that the method plugin is not
designed to work with callbacks because they require an open connection where multiple responses can be sent back (one
response being the function result, the others as a result of a callback). If your functions use callbacks or you expect
multiple responses, you should also set up the [`.callbackPlugin`](#callbackplugin).

### `.callbackPlugin`

| Required  | Default                                               | Sync Required |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| _`false`_ | _`(): { send: ((): { error: string, id: string }) }`_ | 🟢 No         |

The "callback" plugin is very similar to the "method" plugin in the fact that it creates a request with the given RPC
and parses a response from the Prim+RPC server. The primary difference between the two plugins is that the callback
plugin keeps an open connection with the server to receive multiple responses. This is required for callbacks since your
function call may return a value and you expect a response on your provided callback. Callbacks could also be fired
multiple times (like an event handler) so it's important to keep the connection open.

Callbacks in Prim+RPC are typically useful for real-time information where results are not immediately available but you
need a response as soon as one is available, without polling a server at a set interval. This is the case for event
handlers where you may expect a response at some point but not immediately as the result of the function call.

As an example, you may compare the usage of a callback plugin to an open WebSocket connection while a method plugin can
be likened to a single HTTP request/response (this is the actual case for the Browser API plugins).

Of course, many applications don't need support for callbacks which is why the callback plugin is optional, as long as
callbacks are not being used.

You can configure the callback plugin like so:

```typescript
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { createCallbackPlugin } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/browser-websocket"

const callbackPlugin = createCallbackPlugin()
createPrimClient({ callbackPlugin })
```

Each callback plugin may (or may not) include its own options specific to that plugin. You can find a list of available
callback plugins on this documentation website or you can
[follow this guide to create your own](/docs/plugins/create#callback-plugin).

If a callback plugin is given, it's important to note that each plugin used on the Prim+RPC client must have a
[compatible "handler" plugin](#callbackhandler) on the Prim+RPC server (just like method plugins/handlers).

### `.jsonHandler`

| Required  | Default  | Sync Required |
| --------- | -------- | ------------- |
| _`false`_ | _`JSON`_ | 🔴 Yes        |

Functions used with Prim+RPC have to be serialized before sending a function call (RPC) to the server. By default, any
RPC made with Prim+RPC will use the environment's default JSON handler.

This can be overridden by providing your own JSON handler. The given handler must follow the same/similar signature of
the default JSON handler: namely, it needs to have `.parse()` and `.stringify()` methods.

```typescript
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import superjson from "superjson"

createPrimClient({
	// superjson has both a stringify and parse method that can be used by Prim+RPC.
	jsonHandler: superjson,
})
```

This can be useful for parsing additional types. For example, [`superjson`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superjson) is
great for parsing additional JavaScript types, [`devalue`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devalue) is useful for cyclical
references, [`destr`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/destr) for someone security-minded. You could even use
[`yaml`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml) if readability is top priority. These are only examples and you can use any
JSON handler or create your own.

<Alert icon="carbon:warning" type="alert-warning" prose>

At this stage of the project, the JSON handler must serialize data into a string. Binary data support for the JSON
handler is planned for the future to support other potential JSON-like handlers like
[`@msgpack/msgpack`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@msgpack/msgpack). Of course, you can still upload files using
Prim+RPC because, by default, files are extracted from the RPC and sent separately.

</Alert>

It is important to note that this option must be set to the same option on both the server and client since
serialization on the client and deserialization on the server go hand-in-hand.

<Alert icon="carbon:information" type="alert-info" prose>

Some clients may not be able to support a custom JSON handler (for instance, native apps that don't use JavaScript). In
these instances, you may consider creating two Prim+RPC servers that use the same module: one that uses the default JSON
handler, and the second that uses your custom JSON handler (for clients that _can_ support it).

</Alert>

### `.handleError`

| Required  | Default  | Sync Required |
| --------- | -------- | ------------- |
| _`false`_ | _`true`_ | 🔴 Yes        |

By default in JavaScript, the `Error` instance used in JavaScript does not make useful properties like `.message`
enumerable which means that when you try to stringify an `Error` with `JSON` you do not get back these properties.
Instead, you get an empty object.

To make for an easier development experience, Prim+RPC will serialize thrown errors to be sent back to the client using
[serialize-error](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialize-error), when using the default JSON handler. This means that
if you throw an error from a function on a Prim+RPC server, the Prim+RPC client will receive that same error message. By
default, this option is set to `true`.

If the default JSON handler is changed, for instance if you use [superjson](https://github.com/blitz-js/superjson) which
already serializes errors, then this option is set to `false` so as not to conflict with possible error handling done in
the custom JSON handler.

Importantly, if you explicitly specify the `.handleError` property then your choice will be respected regardless of what
JSON handler you are using. The default conditions of setting `handleError` only apply when the option is not provided
by the developer.

This option must be set to the same value on the server and client.

### `.handleBlobs`

| Required  | Default  | Sync Required |
| --------- | -------- | ------------- |
| _`false`_ | _`true`_ | 🔴 Yes        |

The Prim+RPC client can call many server-provided functions including those that expect binary arguments. By default,
Prim+RPC sends RPC using JSON: a format that doesn't support binary data. In order to support binary data there are two
options: The first is overriding the default JSON handler with some JSON-like handler that does support binary data.
Support for these handlers is planned for Prim+RPC but is not available yet. The second however is supported and
involves separating binary data from the RPC.

The `.handleBlobs` option tells Prim+RPC to read the given function arguments for anything Blob-like, including Files
(which are Blobs). The binary arguments are a replaced with an identifier in the RPC. The configured
[`.methodPlugin`](#methodplugin) is then responsible for sending both the RPC and binary data to the Prim+RPC server.
The Prim+RPC server will have a [`.methodHandler`](#methodhandler) that will piece back together the RPC and binary data
into a function call. This is useful because, while JSON cannot support binary data, your method of transport (like
using FormData over HTTP) may be able to transport the binary file(s) and JSON separately.

Since splitting up blobs from RPC is done on the client, this option must also be specified on the server so it knows to
piece these two pieces back together.

<Alert icon="carbon:information" type="alert-info" prose>

Today, blob handling is done with the method plugin/handler but in the future there are plans to support binary data in
the callback handler as well. There's also planned support for JSON-like handlers that support binary data. Prim+RPC is
still in early stages.

</Alert>

### `.endpoint`

| Required  | Default     | Sync Required |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| _`false`_ | _`"/prim"`_ | 🟢 No         |

It is very common to use Prim+RPC with a web server so the `endpoint` option is a URL provided directly on the Prim+RPC
client. This option is passed to both the [`methodHandler`](#methodhandler) and the
[`callbackHandler`](#callbackhandler) functions as an argument so that they can make connections.

This option can be overridden for the [`callbackHandler`](#callbackhandler) by providing the [`wsEndpoint`](#wsendpoint)
option.

<CH.Spotlight>

```typescript
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"

createPrimClient({
	// Provide the path if the Prim+RPC client/server are on the same domain
	endpoint: "/prim",
})
```

---

Path

---

```typescript
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"

createPrimClient({
	// You don't have to provide endpoint if not utilized (for instance when using IPC)
	endpoint: null,
})
```

None

---

```typescript
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"

createPrimClient({
	// Provide a full URL if Prim+RPC server is on separate domain
	// (tip: make sure proper CORS rules are enabled on server)
	endpoint: "https://api.example.com/prim",
})
```

Full URL

---

```typescript
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"

createPrimClient({
	// Pass a different URL depending if rendered on client/server (SSR)
	endpoint: typeof window === "undefined" ? "http://localhost:1234" : "https://api.example.com/prim",
})
```

Conditional URL

</CH.Spotlight>

### `.wsEndpoint`

| Required  | Default | Sync Required |
| --------- | ------- | ------------- |
| _`false`_ | _`""`_  | 🟢 No         |

The [`callbackHandler`](#callbackhandler) may use a different URL from the [`methodHandler`](#methodhandler). In these
events, `wsEndpoint` can be provided. This is common when the method handler uses the HTTPS protocol while the callback
handler uses the WebSocket protocol.

### `.clientBatchTime`

| Required  | Default | Sync Required |
| --------- | ------- | ------------- |
| _`false`_ | _`0`_   | 🟢 No         |

The Prim+RPC client can batch RPCs made with its method handler. This is useful when using Prim+RPC with an HTTP server
and you want to avoid sending hundreds of HTTP requests.

By default, Prim+RPC does not batch requests: the batch time is set to zero. If non-zero then Prim+RPC will wait a short
time, in milliseconds, before sending HTTP requests. Of course, if one function call depends on another then that will
not be batched (because you need the result of the first to make the second call).

As a recommendation, keep this time very low (under `15`ms). The default is `0` (don't batch).

<Alert icon="carbon:information" prose>

This does not apply to the callback handler which will send RPCs one-by-one regardless of this setting. The reason for
this that the method handler is used to send a single request and receive a single response, usually over HTTP, which
results in additional overhead. The callback handler however will typically keep an open connection so there is less
overhead in sending requests, usually over WebSocket, where batching requests isn't as useful.

</Alert>

## Server

The following options are available to the `createPrimServer`:

```typescript
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { createMethodHandler, createCallbackHandler } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/{CHOOSE_YOUR_HANDLER}"

// Tap option name below to see documentation
// You do not need to provide all of these options. This is just a demonstration.

const server = createPrimServer({
	// link[11:33] #client
	// NOTE: all options from client are available here
	// link[2:7] #module
	module: { sayHello: () => "Hello!" },
	// link[2:14] #methodhandler
	methodHandler: createMethodHandler(),
	// link[2:16] #callbackhandler
	callbackHandler: createCallbackHandler(),
	// link[2:7] #prefix
	prefix: "/prim",
	// link[2:10] #allowlist
	allowList: { sayHello: true },
	// link[2:17] #methodsonmethods
	methodsOnMethods: [],
})
```

### `.module`

| Required  | Default       | Sync Required |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| _`false`_ | _`undefined`_ | 🟢 No         |

When an RPC is received by the Prim+RPC server, it will be translated into a function call to be made on the provided
JavaScript module. If a module is not provided then Prim+RPC will return an error.

However, if a module is not provided but a method plugin or callback plugin are given, then the Prim+RPC server will
forward that request using the provided plugins (potentially to a separate Prim+RPC instance that does have the module).

<CH.Spotlight>

```typescript
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import * as module from "./my-local-module"

createPrimServer({
	module,
})
```

---

Local Module

---

```typescript
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"

function helloWorld() {
	return "Hello!"
}
helloWorld.rpc = true

createPrimServer({
	module: { helloWorld },
})
```

Inline Module

---

```typescript
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { startCase } from "lodash"

createPrimServer({
	module: { startCase },
	allowList: { startCase: true },
})
```

External Module

</CH.Spotlight>

<Alert icon="carbon:information" prose>

All functions need to be explicitly allowed before being used with Prim+RPC. This is typically done by adding a `.rpc`
property to each function. When using an external module you may not be able to add a property to an existing function.
In these cases you can use the [`allowList`](#allowlist) option of Prim+RPC to specify that a module is allowed to be
used.

</Alert>

### `.methodHandler`

| Required  | Default        | Sync Required |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| _`false`_ | _`() => void`_ | 🟢 No         |

When a function call is made with the Prim+RPC client, that call is serialized into an RPC and is sent using the
configured [`.methodPlugin`](#methodplugin) to the server of your choice. The Prim+RPC server receives these requests
from your chosen server with its `.methodHandler`. In Prim+RPC, each client _plugin_ needs a corresponding server
_handler_.

The method handler in Prim+RPC is a plugin that integrates with your server (for example, an HTTP server) to receive a
request containing RPC. The responsibility of the method handler is to transform given server properties into RPC, make
the function call, and send back the result to your server in a format that it can understand. Your server then sends a
result back to the client.

There are many method handlers available that you integrate with the server framework of your choice. You can also
[create your own](/docs/plugins/create#method-handler) if a server handler doesn't meet your needs or you need support
for an additional server. An example of how to use an existing method handler is demonstrated below:

```typescript
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { createMethodHandler } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/fastify"

// initialize your server (this example uses Fastify)
import Fastify from "fastify"
const fastify = Fastify()

// and pass this instance to the method handler so the server can be configured to accept RPC
createPrimServer({
	methodHandler: createMethodHandler({ fastify }),
})

const address = await fastify.listen({ port: 1234 })
console.log("Listening:", address)
```

Similar to the [`.methodPlugin`](#methodplugin), the limitation of method handlers is that they receive a single request
(containing one or multiple RPCs) and send a single response (containing one or multiple RPCs). This means that the
method handler cannot support callbacks because multiple responses must be sent back (typically by keeping an open
connection). Prim+RPC has a dedicated handler for callbacks through the use of a [`.callbackHandler`](#callbackhandler).

### `.callbackHandler`

| Required  | Default        | Sync Required |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| _`false`_ | _`() => void`_ | 🟢 No         |

The callback handler serves a similar role to the [`.methodHandler`](#methodhandler) and the goal of this handler is
very similar. The primary difference is that the callback handler is used to maintain a connection to the client from
the server so that callbacks can be called, potentially multiple times.

When a function call is made to Prim+RPC that contains a callback, that function call is turned into an RPC and any
callbacks on that function are transformed into a string identifier with the client's `.callbackPlugin`. This RPC is
sent to the server of your choice which then forwards that RPC to the Prim+RPC server's corresponding
`.callbackHandler`.

The callback handler usually is usually a plugin for some kind of event handler where a persistent connection is kept
open, like a WebSocket connection. The callback handler's responsibility is to transform RPC from the server into a
return value, just like the method handler. However it has an additional responsibility of creating functions in place
of the callbacks that you give and then listening for events on them. When a callback is called, those arguments are
captured and forwarded to the Prim+RPC client.

There are callback handlers available for the server of your choice and it is
[also easy to create your own](/docs/plugins/create#callback-handler). An example of how to utilize an existing callback
handler is given below:

```typescript
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { createCallbackHandler } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/ws"

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 1234 })

createPrimServer({
	callbackHandler: createCallbackHandler({ wss }),
})
```

### `.prefix`

| Required  | Default     | Sync Required |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| _`false`_ | _`"/prim"`_ | 🟢 No         |

This option is used to configure HTTP routers used inside of a method/callback handler. The prefix will become the path
for which the Prim+RPC client's plugins will communicate.

In general, if you are using an HTTP/WS server with Prim+RPC then the `.prefix` option given on the Prim+RPC server is
the pathname that you should give as the [`.endpoint](#endpoint) in the Prim+RPC client. If you are not using a
transport that makes use of a URL (i.e. Web Workers, other forms of IPC) then this option isn't needed.

As an example, using some HTTP server:

<CH.Code>

```ts server.ts
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"

createPrimServer({
	prefix: "/my-rpc-endpoint",
})

// ... start HTTP server
```

---

```ts client.ts
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"

// We'll pretend that the server is running on http://localhost:1234
createPrimClient({
	endpoint: "http://localhost:1234/my-rpc-endpoint",
})
```

</CH.Code>

This option also tells Prim+RPC what parts of a path to exclude if a request is given over a URL. While most requests
are given using the Prim+RPC client, you could also make a simple request like so:

```zsh
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:1234/my-rpc-endpoint/sayHello?name=Ted&greeting=Hello
```

This example is the equivalent of calling `sayHello({ name: "Ted", greeting: "Hello" })`. Prim+RPC will know to remove
the `/my-rpc-endpoint` part of the path because we configured it as the `.prefix`. Making requests over a URL isn't the
primary use of Prim+RPC but it is possible as long as the method handler supports it.

### `.allowList`

| Required  | Default | Sync Required |
| --------- | ------- | ------------- |
| _`false`_ | _`{}`_  | 🟢 No         |

All functions provided to Prim+RPC must explicitly be marked usable as RPC. This is typically done by adding a `.rpc`
property to the function in question. Sometimes this is not possible, such as when using a separate package directly
with Prim+RPC that does not have an RPC property. In these events, you may specify an allowed list of functions that can
be used.

When Prim+RPC receives an RPC it will check the `.rpc` property and, if not found, follow the allow-list. The allow list
is expected to follow the same structure as the module you provide. The allow list below is a simple example and follows
the same structure of the module provided:

```typescript
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"

// it's easier to specify the `.rpc` property on functions but below is also completely valid
createPrimServer({
	module: {
		hi() {
			return "Hi!"
		},
		good: {
			bye() {
				return "Goodbye!"
			},
		},
	},
	allowList: {
		hi: true,
		good: {
			bye: true,
		},
	},
})
```

### `.methodsOnMethods`

| Required  | Default | Sync Required |
| --------- | ------- | ------------- |
| _`false`_ | _`[]`_  | 🟢 No         |

By default, Prim+RPC will not answer methods calls made on a function. For instance, if you have a function named
`hello()`, you cannot call `hello.toString()`. However, there may be circumstances where you'd like to allow certain
methods on a defined function. For instance, the following could be useful:

```typescript
function sayHello() {
	return "Hello!"
}
sayHello.rpc = true
sayHello.docs = function () {
	return "I say hello!"
}
```

By default, `sayHello.docs()` is not allowed to be called. This can be fixed by specifying the following:

```typescript
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { sayHello } from "./previous-example"

createPrimServer({
	module: { sayHello },
	methodsOnMethods: ["docs"],
})
```

Now, any function that has a `.docs()` method can be called.

It is recommended, but not required, that you choose unique method names and avoid exposing or using the same names as
built-in methods, when using this option.
