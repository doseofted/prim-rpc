This guide shows you how to fully set up a project from scratch and teaches you how Prim+RPC works.

If you'd like to quickly get started using Prim+RPC in a pre-configured project, you may reference
[the available examples](/docs/examples) on this website to act as a starting point.

</Alert>

In this guide, we'll learn how to set up a project to use Prim+RPC. If you don't have an existing project to set up, you
can easily download an example project to follow along. This example project doesn't yet use Prim+RPC but we'll learn in
this guide how to do that! The command below will download the example project or you can download the it
[directly from GitHub](https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/starter):

```zsh
// link[18:1000] https://github.com/doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/tree/main/starter
npx giget@latest gh:doseofted/prim-rpc-examples/starter prim-rpc-examples/starter
```

Once you've finished this guide and set up your project, you can [learn how to write functions](/docs/usage) to be
shared as Prim+RPC.

## Table of Contents

## Installation

We will be setting up Prim+RPC on both the **server** and the **client**.

The server is where your JavaScript functions are located; functions that you'd like to share somewhere else. The client
will call these JavaScript functions remotely. Typically the server is some HTTP or WebSocket server and the client is a
web browser or native application that makes requests to this server. In other cases, the server may be running in one
process while the client is running in a separate process on the same machine. However you're using up Prim+RPC, this
guide should apply to all relationships between client and server.

The first step to use Prim+RPC will be to add the library to both the server and client portions of your project. If
your client and server are located in separate projects, you should install the following packages in both:

- **Prim+RPC**: contains both client and server tools for making RPC; framework-agnostic
- **Prim+RPC Plugins**: framework-specific plugins for Prim+RPC, both client and server side

You may optionally install **Prim+RPC Tooling** for helpful Prim+RPC-related tools. The Tooling package is completely
optional and includes utilities like a documentation generator as well as a build plugin that prevents the import of a
function from the server directly (also optional). The Tooling package is included in the install commands below.

Provided are installation commands for common package managers.

<CH.Code>

```zsh npm
npm add @doseofted/prim-rpc @doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins @doseofted/prim-rpc-tooling
```

```zsh yarn
yarn add @doseofted/prim-rpc @doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins @doseofted/prim-rpc-tooling
```

```zsh pnpm
pnpm add @doseofted/prim-rpc @doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins @doseofted/prim-rpc-tooling
```

```zsh bun

```

</CH.Code>

Now you're ready to start setting up the client and the server! We'll start with the server first.

This setup guide will use Prim+RPC plugins for Fastify and WS for demonstration but you may swap these out the framework
of your choice. Find available [plugins for the server](/docs/plugins/server),
[plugins for the client](/docs/plugins/client), and [plugins for process communication](/docs/plugins/ipc).

## Server Setup

The Prim+RPC server hosts your JavaScript functions and makes them available to the Prim+RPC client. You can write
regular JavaScript functions and then pass them to Prim+RPC to make them available to the server.

The first step is to write a JavaScript function that we want to call from the client. Let's use the example from the
homepage:

```typescript server.ts
/** This function just says hello. */
export function sayHello(x: string, y: string) {
	return `${x}, meet ${y}.`
}

const result = sayHello("Frontend", "Backend") // result === "Frontend, meet Backend."
```

The next step will be to give this function to the Prim+RPC server:

```ts server.ts mark=1,7,9:10
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"

/** This function just says hello. */
export function sayHello(x: string, y: string) {
	return `${x}, meet ${y}.`
}
sayHello.rpc = true

const module = { sayHello }
createPrimServer({ module })
```

We've now configured the Prim+RPC server with our function by providing the
[`.module` option](/docs/reference/configuration#module). Notice that we added a property `.rpc` with a value of `true`
to the function. This will signal to Prim+RPC that it's allowed to call this function. This is valid JavaScript since
functions in JavaScript are Objects and can have additional properties.

<Alert prose icon="carbon:information">

If you can't add the the `.rpc` property (maybe the
[function is frozen](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze))
then you can also specify that it's allowed to be called by using the
[`.allowList`](/docs/reference/configuration#allowlist) option on the Prim+RPC server.

</Alert>

This Prim+RPC server doesn't do much by itself. In order to communicate with a remote Prim+RPC client, we must define
some method of transport. This is accomplished by using Prim+RPC's server-side "handler" plugins. There are
[many handlers available](/docs/plugins/server) for your server. For this example, we'll use a handler for Fastify (an
HTTP server framework) but you can choose the handler for your own server framework. First, let's set up a basic Fastify
server:

```ts server.ts mark=2,4,15
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import Fastify from "fastify"

const fastify = Fastify()

/** This function just says hello. */
export function sayHello(x: string, y: string) {
	return `${x}, meet ${y}.`
}
sayHello.rpc = true

const module = { sayHello }
createPrimServer({ module })

await fastify.listen({ port: 3001 })
```

Now we can set up the [Fastify-specific "method handler" plugin](/docs/plugins/server#fastify) which will handle method
calls (so we can call the `sayHello()` method on the Prim+RPC client).

```ts server.ts mark=3,16
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import Fastify from "fastify"
import { createMethodHandler } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/fastify"

const fastify = Fastify()

/** This function just says hello. */
export function sayHello(x: string, y: string) {
	return `${x}, meet ${y}.`
}
sayHello.rpc = true

const module = { sayHello }
createPrimServer({
	module,
	methodHandler: createMethodHandler({ fastify }),
})

await fastify.listen({ port: 3001 })
```

Now we can call our `sayHello()` function from the client using the Fastify server that we set up. Note that this server
is running at `http://localhost:3001/prim` because we'll use this location in the Prim+RPC client next. Note that if you
want to change the default `/prim` path, you can always set the
[`.prefix` option](/docs/reference/configuration#prefix).

<Alert prose icon="carbon:information">

Prim+RPC works with the server of your choice through the use of handler plugins.

The **method handler** is used to resolve method calls in Prim+RPC (but can't resolve callbacks on a method).

The **callback handler** is optional and can be used both to resolve methods but also to resolve callbacks given on a
method. You can use both a method and callback handler with Prim+RPC at the same time or use one of them at a time (your
choice).

</Alert>

As a last step, we'll export the types of our `module` so that we can utilize them from the Prim+RPC client.

```ts server.ts mark=21
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import Fastify from "fastify"
import { createMethodHandler } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/fastify"

const fastify = Fastify()

/** This function just says hello. */
export function sayHello(x: string, y: string) {
	return `${x}, meet ${y}.`
}
sayHello.rpc = true

const module = { sayHello }
createPrimServer({
	module,
	methodHandler: createMethodHandler({ fastify }),
})

await fastify.listen({ port: 3001 })

export type { module }
```

Note that we're only exporting the TypeScript types and not the function itself. This step is not required to use
Prim+RPC but can be incredibly useful if you'd like to have typed function calls on the Prim+RPC client.

Now we're ready to move on and set up the client!

## Client Setup

The Prim+RPC client communicates with the Prim+RPC server. You simply call your JavaScript function on the client, as if
it exists on the client (but it's actually on the server), and get a result back. The client intercepts the function
call and sends that to the Prim+RPC server. Once a response is received from the server, the client receives this result
and hands it back to the function that you called.

Let's set up a Prim+RPC client. From the [Server Setup](#server-setup) section we know that our server is running at
`http://localhost:3001/prim` so let's pass that address to Prim+RPC like so:

```ts client.ts
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"

const endpoint = "http://localhost:3001/prim"
const prim = createPrimClient({ endpoint })
```

Like the Prim+RPC server, this doesn't do much by itself. In order to communicate with the Prim+RPC server, we define
some sort of transport. This is accomplished with a client-side plugin. There are
[many plugins available](/docs/plugins/client) for your client. For this example, we'll use a
[plugin for the Fetch API](/docs/plugins/client#fetch-api-browser) since it's built into the web browser.

```ts client.ts mark=2,7
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { createMethodPlugin } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/browser"

const endpoint = "http://localhost:3001/prim"
const prim = createPrimClient({
	endpoint,
	methodPlugin: createMethodPlugin(),
})
```

We've now set up a "method plugin" that will be used to send method calls to the server of our choice. In this case, it
is Fastify which is available at the address configured with the `.endpoint` option.

It is important to use a compatible plugin and handler. For instance, since we use a server-side handler that accepts
HTTP requests, we need to use a client-side plugin that can send HTTP requests.

<Alert prose icon="carbon:information">

The Prim+RPC client communicates with your server through the use of plugins.

The **method plugin** receives a function call from the client, sends and receives results from the server which are
given back to the Prim+RPC client. The method _plugin_ communicates with the method _handler_ defined on the Prim+RPC
server.

The **callback plugin** is optional. It receives a function call from the client when a callback is given, sends it to
the server, and awaits multiple results from the server. As these results are received, they are given back to the
Prim+RPC client. The callback _plugin_ communicates with the callback _handler_ defined on the Prim+RPC server.

</Alert>

We can actually use the client right now! However if you're using TypeScript then you'll notice that we don't yet have
type definitions. Let's add them now. The TypeScript definitions that we exported from the server can be imported in the
client and passed as a generic argument, like so:

```ts client.ts mark=3,6
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { createMethodPlugin } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/browser"
import type { module } from "./server"

const endpoint = "http://localhost:3001/prim"
const prim = createPrimClient<typeof module>({
	endpoint,
	methodPlugin: createMethodPlugin(),
})
```

<Alert prose icon="carbon:information">

In this example, we're importing types from a folder named `./server` collocated with the client. If your project is set
up using a monolithic repository (monorepo), you may import the package containing the server types. If the server is
located in a completely separate repository, you may publish the types of the server to a registry, e.g. NPM or
Verdaccio, and then import from that package (this package could be either public or private and only needs to export
the types, not code).

</Alert>

If importing types makes you uneasy, you may use the
[(optional) build plugin](/docs/reference/tooling#prevent-import-utility) to ensure that code is never imported
accidentally. This is usually unnecessary but is available if needed.

Now let's go ahead and make a remote function call!

```ts client.ts mark=10
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { createMethodPlugin } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/browser"
import type { module } from "./server"

const endpoint = "http://localhost:3001/prim"
const prim = createPrimClient<typeof module>({
	endpoint,
	methodPlugin: createMethodPlugin(),
})

const result = await prim.sayHello("Frontend", "Backend") // result === "Frontend, meet Backend."
```

Note that we must await the result of the function even though the function does not return a Promise on the server.
This is because the function doesn't actually exist on the client and is retrieved remotely from the server. Just like
we must await a Fetch API call, we must also await all functions defined on the Prim+RPC client since the result is
fetched.

We're now able to make method calls to the server as if they exist on the client!

There's one more optional step that you can complete. If you'd like to support callbacks on a method you define on the
server, you'll need to set up a callback handler on the server and a callback plugin on the client. If you don't use
callback then this isn't necessary. If you would like to set this up, follow along in the next step!

Otherwise, you're now ready to [learn how to further use Prim+RPC](/docs/usage). You can also customize the Prim+RPC
client and server by following the [configuration reference](/docs/reference/configuration).

## Use Callbacks

Utilizing callbacks on a method used with Prim+RPC is optional but a requires a special handler on the server and a
plugin on the client. Follow the [Server Setup](#server-setup) and [Client Setup](#client-setup) guides first before
completing this section.

Callbacks in Prim+RPC are handled by creating a persistent connection from the client to the server. As callbacks are
called on the server, arguments are passed to the client over this connection. In order to support this feature, it's
not enough to use an HTTP server like Fastify where each request is followed by a single response. We need to use a
server that supports multiple responses over time, like a WebSocket server would provide.

So let's set up a WebSocket server first. We can easily do this like so (using the
[ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) package):

```ts server.ts mark=4,7
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import Fastify from "fastify"
import { createMethodHandler } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/fastify"
import { WebSocketServer } from "ws"

const fastify = Fastify()
const wss = new WebSocketServer({ server: fastify.server })

/** This function just says hello. */
export function sayHello(x: string, y: string) {
	return `${x}, meet ${y}.`
}
sayHello.rpc = true

const module = { sayHello }
createPrimServer({
	module,
	methodHandler: createMethodHandler({ fastify }),
})

await fastify.listen({ port: 3001 })

export type { module }
```

Now our WebSocket server is available! We'll register this with the Prim+RPC server by
[providing a callback handler](/docs/plugins/server#ws).

```ts server.ts mark=4,20
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import Fastify from "fastify"
import { createMethodHandler } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/fastify"
import { createCallbackHandler } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/ws"
import { WebSocketServer } from "ws"

const fastify = Fastify()
const wss = new WebSocketServer({ server: fastify.server })

/** This function just says hello. */
export function sayHello(x: string, y: string) {
	return `${x}, meet ${y}.`
}
sayHello.rpc = true

const module = { sayHello }
createPrimServer({
	module,
	methodHandler: createMethodHandler({ fastify }),
	callbackHandler: createCallbackHandler({ wss }),
})

await fastify.listen({ port: 3001 })

export type { module }
```

Of course, this callback handler is only useful if we have a callback that we want to use. Let's add a new method on the
server that has a callback:

```ts server.ts mark=16:23,25
import { createPrimServer } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import Fastify from "fastify"
import { createMethodHandler } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/fastify"
import { createCallbackHandler } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/ws"
import { WebSocketServer } from "ws"

const fastify = Fastify()
const wss = new WebSocketServer({ server: fastify.server })

/** This function just says hello. */
export function sayHello(x: string, y: string) {
	return `${x}, meet ${y}.`
}
sayHello.rpc = true

/** This function takes a message and types each letter. */
export function typeMessage(message: string, typeLetter: (typed: string) => void, speed = 300) {
	let timeout = 0
	message.split("").forEach(letter => {
		setTimeout(() => typeLetter(letter), ++timeout * speed)
	})
}
typeMessage.rpc = true

const module = { sayHello, typeMessage }
createPrimServer({
	module,
	methodHandler: createMethodHandler({ fastify }),
	callbackHandler: createCallbackHandler({ wss }),
})

await fastify.listen({ port: 3001 })

export type { module }
```

Perfect! Now we can set up the client.

Since we're using a WebSocket server as a callback handler, we'll need callback plugin that supports WebSocket
connections on the client. We'll use
[Prim+RPC's callback plugin for the browser](/docs/plugins/client#websocket-api-browser) which uses the WebSocket API.

```ts client.ts mark=2,8
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { createMethodPlugin, createCallbackPlugin } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/browser"
import type { module } from "./server"

const endpoint = "http://localhost:3001/prim"
const prim = createPrimClient<typeof module>({
	endpoint,
	methodPlugin: createMethodPlugin(),
	callbackPlugin: createCallbackPlugin(),
})

const result = await prim.sayHello("Frontend", "Backend") // result === "Frontend, meet Backend."
```

Now we can make use of our callback!

```ts client.ts mark=12:14
import { createPrimClient } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc"
import { createMethodPlugin, createCallbackPlugin } from "@doseofted/prim-rpc-plugins/browser"

const endpoint = "http://localhost:3001/prim"
const prim = createPrimClient({
	endpoint,
	methodPlugin: createMethodPlugin(),
	callbackPlugin: createCallbackPlugin(),
})

const result = await prim.sayHello("Frontend", "Backend") // result === "Frontend, meet Backend."
prim.typeMessage(result, letter => {
	console.log(letter) // all letters in result, one-by-one
})
```

You're now ready to [learn how to further use Prim+RPC](/docs/usage). You can also customize the Prim+RPC client and
server by following the [configuration reference](/docs/reference/configuration).
