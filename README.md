[![Prim+RPC. Pictured are two very short JavaScript files: a simple function on the server-side and a call to that function on the client-side. Tagline: "Backend, meet Frontend"](./misc/docs-screenshot.png)](https://prim.doseofted.me/)

**Prim+RPC is a bridge between JavaScript environments.** Call functions on the server as if they exist on the client,
without the wrappers. It's just JavaScript. You could bridge:

- Web server and client
- Two browser tabs
- Main thread and Web Worker
- Two entirely separate processes
- Or **any two separated JavaScript environments**

Prim+RPC is framework-agnostic (bring your own server _and_ client tools), fully-typed, lightweight, doesn't require a
compile-step, and is **loaded with features**:

- File uploads
- Callback support
- Custom serialization
- Error handling
- Request batching
- HTML form handling
- Documentation generation
- Access control

Best of all, **if you know JavaScript, you already know how to use Prim+RPC**. If you want access to a function, just
call it: less setup, easier access, quicker development of your API.

Focus less on message transport and more on the message being sent, **with minimal setup**, using Prim+RPC:

## Release Plan

Prim+RPC is currently prerelease software but the goal is to reach a stable release. Prim+RPC itself (framework-agnostic
core of the project) will become stable first. Before Prim+RPC is released however individual plugins
(framework-specific code, known as method/callback plugins) will need to become stable since Prim+RPC depends on them.
Lastly, Prim+RPC's optional tooling (such as documentation generation) will become stable.

There is not yet a specific target date for these releases but I expect the Prim+RPC packages to generally become stable
by end-of-year. This time frame depends on the initial success of this project and the timeline of projects that will
use Prim+RPC (such as [Prim+CMS](https://prim.doseofted.me/cms) and my [new portfolio](https://doseofted.me/) website).
