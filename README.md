[![Prim+RPC. Pictured are two very short JavaScript files: a simple function on the server-side and a call to that function on the client-side. Tagline: "Backend, meet Frontend"](./.github/docs-screenshot.png)](https://prim.doseofted.me/)

**Prim+RPC is a bridge between JavaScript environments.** Call functions on the server as if they exist on the client,
without the wrappers. It's just JavaScript. You could bridge:

- Web server and client
- Two browser tabs
- Main thread and Web Worker
- Two entirely separate processes
- Or **any two separated JavaScript environments**

Prim+RPC is framework-agnostic (bring your own server _and_ client tools), fully-typed, lightweight, doesn't require a
compile-step, and is **loaded with features**:

- File uploads
- Callback support
- Custom serialization
- Error handling
- Request batching
- HTML form handling
- Documentation generation
- Access control

Best of all, **if you know JavaScript, you already know how to use Prim+RPC**. If you want access to a function, just
call it: less setup, easier access, quicker development of your API.

Focus less on message transport and more on the message being sent, **with minimal setup**, using Prim+RPC:

Prim+RPC is planned to become stable by the end of 2023 (and is on track to be stable much sooner than that).

Prim+RPC Core, the framework-agnostic core of the project, will become stable first and will be released once the
default plugins are stable. Lastly, Prim+RPC's optional tooling (such as documentation generation) will become stable.
At this point, the alpha tag is planned to be removed. Once I am using Prim+RPC in production, a v1.0 will be released.
