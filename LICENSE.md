You will find a license file (`LICENSE`) in each project's folder that describes the detailed license for which it is
made available. If a license is not made available then it is proprietary meaning that usage is unauthorized.

> **Warning** The Prim+RPC name and logo (as well as the Dose of Ted logo) are excluded from all licenses and usage of
> them outside of fair use is strictly prohibited.
