# Licenses

This is a monolithic repository consisting of several projects. The repository itself is proprietary while individual
projects are separately licensed:

| Project                | Folder            | License                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Prim+RPC Core          | `./libs/rpc`      | [To be determined](./libs/rpc/LICENSE.md)     |
| Prim+RPC Plugins       | `./libs/plugins`  | [To be determined](./libs/plugins/LICENSE.md) |
| Prim+RPC Tooling       | `./libs/tooling`  | [To be determined](./libs/tooling/LICENSE.md) |
| Prim+RPC UI            | `./libs/ui`       | [To be determined](./libs/ui/LICENSE.md)      |
| Example Library        | `./libs/example`  | [To be determined](./libs/example/LICENSE.md) |
| Prim+RPC Documentation | `./docs`          | [To be determined](./docs/LICENSE.md)         |
| Prim+RPC Website       | `./apps/frontend` | Proprietary (unauthorized)                    |
| Example Server         | `./apps/backend`  | Proprietary (unauthorized)                    |

You will find a license file (`LICENSE.md`) in each project's folder that describes the detailed license for which it is
made available. If a license is not made available then it is proprietary meaning that usage is unauthorized.

> **Warning** The Prim+RPC name and logo (as well as the Dose of Ted logo) are excluded from all licenses and usage of
> them outside of fair use is strictly prohibited.
