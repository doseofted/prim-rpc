# Prim Restructure

Todo after restructure:

- Consider using husky for git hooks and "changesets" tool (this may have to be done later, not really critical)
- Search for all added `eslint-disable` in files and try resolving each issue, otherwise lax the rules a bit (they're nearly impossible to follow now)
